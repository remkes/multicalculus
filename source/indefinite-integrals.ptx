  <title>The Indefinite Integral</title>
  <p>
    A major goal of Calculus III was the extention of the derivative
    to multivariable functions: particularly to parametric curves and
    scalar fields. This course pursues the matching goal of extending
    the integral to multivariable functions. The course will consider
    new kinds of integrals involving parametric curves in <xref
    ref="section-line-integrals" />, as part of the material called
    Vector Calculus. For the start, though, I'm interesting in scalar
    fields. What should it mean to integrate a scalar field? Well,
    there are two kinds of integral: definite and indefinite, so the
    questions needs to asked twice. First, I'm going to think about
    indefinite integrals. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The indefinite integral <m>\int f dx</m> was a notation for 
    <em>all</em> anti-derivatives of the single-variable function. Is
    there a multivariable version of this anti-derivative? Calculus
    III tried to extend the derivative to multi-variable functions.
    The result was a collection of construction: partial derivatives,
    tangent (hyper-)planes, gradients and the Jacobian matrix.
    However, none of these notions of the derivative gave a new
    multi-variable funciton. Therefore, there isn't a nice notion of
    anti-derivative: going back doesn't make sense, since going
    forward led to more complicated constructions. If <m>f(x,y,z)</m>
    is a scalar field, then <m>\int f</m> doesn't have any clear
    meaning. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I can, however, take indefinite integrals in one variable, much
    like partial derivatives. If <m>f(x,y,z)</m> is a multivariable
    continuous function, then the following three integrals are the
    counterparts of partial differentiation. In each of the following,
    I pretend the other two variables are constant; only the variable
    indicated by the infintesimal term is non-constant.

    In addition to extending the integral, a major theme of this
    course will be extensions of the fundamental theorem. Let me
    remind you of the various forms of the fundametanl theorem.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f: [a,b] \rightarrow \RR</m> be a continuous function.
        Then if <m>F(x)</m> is any antiderivative of <m>f</m> (i.e.
        <m>F^\prime(x) = f(x)</m>). Any of the following
        expressions are versions of the Fundamental Theorem of
        Calculus.
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \int_a^b F^\prime(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \int f(x) dx = F(x) + c 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \int F^\prime(x) dx = F(x) + c 
        </mrow>
      </md>
      <p>
        All these equations essentially encode the same concept: that
        integration and differentiation are inverse processes. 
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    The fundamental gheorem deserves its name: it really is the basis
    for single variable calculus, giving the deep and remarkable
    connection between differentiate and integration. As this course
    extends the derivative and the integral to multivariable
    situations, there will be new opportunities to create connections
    between new derivatives and new integrals in the spirit of the
    fundamental theorem. Major goals of this course are new theorems
    that extend the fundanmental theorem. Therefore, whenever I can, I
    will be looking for these fundamental-theorem type constructions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, I had defined partial derivatives and indefinite integrals
    in one variable. These are essentially one-variable constructions;
    I am just pretending all the other variables are constant.
    Therefore, the conventional single-variable fundamental theorem
    applies. Here is how I would write the fundamental theorem for a
    function of three varialbes, using partial derivatives and
    indefinite integrals in one variable. 
  </p>

    <mrow>
      \int \frac{\del}{\del x} f(x,y,z) dx \amp = f(x,y,z) + g(y,z)
    </mrow>
    <mrow>
      \int \frac{\del}{\del y} f(x,y,z) dy \amp = f(x,y,z) + g(x,z)
    </mrow>
    <mrow>
      \int \frac{\del}{\del z} f(x,y,z) dz \amp = f(x,y,z) + g(x,y)
    </mrow>
  </md>
  <p>
    Note that the <sq>constants of integration</sq> <m>g</m> now may
    involve the other variables. When I do single variable integration
    or partial differentiation, I pretend all the other variables are
    constant; therefore, the constant term can include those
    variables.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is nothing more to be said about the indefinite integral and
    this is as far as I can extend the notation. All the future
    extensions of the integral (and there are many!) will be
    extensions of thd definite integral.
