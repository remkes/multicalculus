    <title>Analyzing the Sums in the Riemann Integral</title>
    <p>
      I want to be able to calculate the multivariable Riemann
      integral.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) dV = \lim_{k \rightarrow
      \infty} \sum_{l=0}^{k^n} f(x_l^*) \Delta V
    </me>
    <p>
      The original Riemann integral was already a very difficult
      definition to actually work with. This multivariable version is
      even worse, since I haven't specified how to actually do the sum
      over all <m>k^n</m> subintervals. This is where I want to start:
      with a better understanding of this sum.  However, working to
      this understanding in full generality or <m>\RR^n</m> at the
      start is very unwieldy, so I'll start with a function
      <m>f(x,y)</m> defined on an interval in <m>\RR^2</m>. As noted
      before, In <m>\RR^2</m>, I will write <m>\Delta A</m> and
      <m>dA</m> instead of <m>\Delta V</m> and <m>dV</m>, since the
      pieces of an interval in<m>\RR^2</m> are rectangles and have
      area, not volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider an interval in <m>\RR^n</m>: <m>I = [a_1,b_1] \times
      [a_2,b_2]</m>. If I divide the two single-variable intervals into
      <m>k</m> pieces, I can choose <m>x_{i_1}^* \in [a_1,b_1]</m> and
      <m>y_{i_2}^* \in [a_2,b_2]</m>. With these choices, the point
      <m>(x_{i_1}^*, y_{i_2}^*)</m> is a point in one of the
      subintervals of <m>I</m>. As both the indices <m>i_1</m> and
      <m>i_2</m> count from <m>1</m> to <m>k</m>. I want to count the
      two sums independently, so all count to <m>k_1</m> in <m>x</m>
      and to <m>k_2</m> in <m>y</m>. This might mean that I have more
      rectancles in a row than in a column, or vice-versa, but that's
      fine; the rectangles are still subintervals making up the whole
      interval. The sum can now be written as a double sum over these
      two indices. The limit also needs to take both upper bounds to
      infinity.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x,y) dA = \lim_{k_1 \rightarrow \infty} \lim_{k_2
      \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i_1=1}^{k_1} \sum_{i_2=1}^{k_2}
      f(x_{i_1}^*,y_{i_2}^*) \Delta A 
    </me>
    <p>
      Instead of writing <m>\Delta A</m> for the area of a subintervals,
      I could write this as the product of the height and width of this
      rectangle. The width, <m>\Delta x</m>, is
      <m>\frac{b_1-a_1}{k_1}</m>, the length of the subdivision in the
      <m>x</m> variable. The height, <m>\Delta y</m>, is likewise
      <m>\frac{b_2-a_2}{k_2}</m>. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x,y) dA = \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}
      \sum_{i_1=1}^{k_1} \sum_{i_2=1}^{k_2} f(x_{i_1}^*,y_{i_2}^*)
      \Delta x \Delta y 
    </me>
    <p>
      Now, let me group this using some brackets, moving some
      terms in and out of sums (recall than anything that doesn't
      involve the index of a particular sum and be moved out from the
      sum.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x,y) dA = \lim_{k_1 \rightarrow \infty}
      \sum_{i_1=1}^{k_1} \left[ \lim_{k_2 \rightarrow \infty} 
      \sum_{i_2=1}^{k_2} f(x_{i_1}^*,y_{i_2}^*) \Delta y
      \right] \Delta x
    </me>
    <p>
      Now the term inside the brackets is just a single-variable Riemann
      integral. As far as the sum inside the brackets is concerns,
      <m>x</m> and <m>x_{i_1}^*</m> are constants. The sum only changes
      the <m>y</m> coordinates. I can treat this as a single variable
      integral in the variable <m>y</m>.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x,y) dA = \lim_{k_1 \rightarrow \infty}
      \sum_{i_1}^{k_1} \left[ \int_c^d f(x_{i_1}^*,y) dy \right]
      \Delta x
    </me>
    <p>
      Now I can consider the outside sum and, again, this is just a
      single-variable Riemann integral. It treats the variable <m>y</m>
      as constant and integrate in <m>x</m>. Let me write this as an
      integral as well. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x,y) dA = \int_a^b \left[ \int_c^d f(x,y) dy \right]
      dx
    </me>
    <p>
      This is called an <term>iterated integral</term> and it will be
      the calculation techinque for definite integrals. Every definite
      integral of a multivariable function on an interval can be treated
      as a iterated single-variable integral in each variable
      independently. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In an iterated integral, I must always from the inside out: the
      infinitesimal piece <m>dx</m> or <m>dy</m> that is closest to the
      function acts first. Its bounds are written on the right, closest
      to the function. That integral is a single-variable integration,
      pretending that the other variables are constant, as was the
      case with partial derivatives. Then, once the firstintegration
      is finished, I proceed outward to the next integral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iterated integrals also work in higher dimensions: I just iterate
      through the variables. In <m>\RR^3</m>, over the interval <m>I =
      [a_1,b_1] \times [a_2,b_2] \times [a_3,b_3]</m> with three
      iterations, this is the setup. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{I} f(x,y,z) dV = \int_{a_1}^{b_1} \left[ \int_{a_2}^{b_2}
      \left[ \int_{a_3}^{b_3} f(x,y,z) dz \right] dy \right] dx
    </me>
    <p>
      Notice that the bounds of integration always match with
      the correct infinitesimal piece, working from the inside out.
      I won't write the full version in <m>\RR^n</m>, but it works same
      way. It has <m>n</m> iterated pieces. 
    </p>

    <title>Fubini's Theorem</title>
    <p>
      You might ask, at this point, what happens if I change the
      order? I have to choose an order for these iterated integrals.
      Fubini's Theorem tells me that I am able to choose the order.
      This is the counterpart to Clairaut's Theorem for partial
      derivative, which told me that I could change the order of
      iterated partial derivatives. 
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-fubini">
      <statement>
        <p>
          (Fubini's Theorem) If <m>f: I \rightarrow \RR</m> is an
          integrable function on an closed interval, then the iterated
          integral is independent of the choice or order. Any ordering
          of the variables will result in the same value.

    <title>Examples</title>
    <p>
      I'm going to work through a few examples to demonstrate the
      process. I should mention on caution as the start: like with
      partial derivatives, I need to carefully keep track of which
      variable I'm working with at any time.  It's easy to confuse the
      variable of integration and substitue for the wrong variables
      when you get to evaluating bounds. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the interval <m>I = [0,1] \times[3,6]</m> and the
          function <m>f(x,y) = e^x + e^y</m>. I'm going to do an
          iterated integral to solve this, with the <m>y</m> variable
          inside and the <m>x</m> variable outside. That means I'll
          integrate in <m>y</m>, like a normal single variable
          integral, and then evaluate on the bounds for <m>y</m>. Then
          the <m>y</m> variable will be entirely gone and I will
          proceed with the single-variable definite integral in
          <m>x</m>.  In this example, I've carefully labelled the
          bound to remind myself which variable to replace. This isn't
          standard notation, but a nice reminder for the first
          example.

    <title>Improper Integrals</title>
    <p>
      An function defined on a closed interval has to include values
      on the boundary of the interval. Assuming the function is
      piecewise continuous (as if the habit in this course), this
      means that the function cannot diverge to infinity near the edge
      of the interval. However, an function which is only defined on
      an open interval can have any kind of behaviour near the
      boundaries, including diverging to infinity. I would like to be
      able to handle this kind of integral as well
    </p>
    <p>
      In single variable calculus, we used improper integrals to deal
      with functions with problematic behaviour near the boundary of
      an interval. Thankfully, this translates nicely to iterated
      integrals. If a function diverges to infinity near the edge of
      an interval, then at least one piece of the iterated integral
      (and perhaps more than one piece) will be a single-variable
      improper integral. We approach these as we did in single
      variable integration: with limits approaching the problematic
      endpoint(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a function <m>f: (0,1] \times (0,1] \rightarrow \RR</m>
      that diverged to infinity when <m>x \rightarrow 0</m>. Here is
      the iterated integral.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_I f(x,y) dA = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 f(x,y) dy dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      Since the problems happen at the edge of the <m>x</m> interval,
      the resulting improper integral uses a limit for the <m>x</m>
      part of the iterated integral.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_I f(x,y) dA = \lim_{a \rightarrow 0^+} \int_a^1 \int_0^1
      f(x,y) dy dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      If, instead, the function diverged to infinity as <m>y
      \rightarrow 0</m>, then the limit would be in the <m>y</m> part
      of the iterated integral. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_I f(x,y) dA = \int_0^1 \left[ \lim_{a \rightarrow 0^+}
      \int_a^1 f(x,y) dy \right] dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      Improper integrals also allow us to consider infinite domains of
      integral. For example, if I want to integrate over all of
      <m>\RR^2</m>, I set it us as follows.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{\RR^2} f(x,y) dA = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \lim_{b
      \rightarrow \infty} \int_{[-a,a]\times[-b,b]} f(x,y) dA
    </me>
    <p>
      Then I can write this as in iterated integral where both pieces
      are improper integrals. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{\RR^2} f(x,y) dA = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty}

      If <m>f(x,y) = g(x)h(y)</m> is a separable function, then its
      integral separates entirely into two single variable integrals.

        \int_I f(x,y) dy dx \amp = \int_a^b \int_c^d g(x) h(y) dy dx

        \amp = \int_a^b g(x) \left[ \int_c^d h(y) dy \right] dx

        \amp = \left[ \int_c^d h(y) dy \right] \left[ \int_a^b
        g(x) dx \right]

    <p>
      The operations in this calculation are justified because the
      pieces which I move in and out of a integral do not involve
      that variable of integration. In this way, I can separate the
      integral into two single variable integrals.
