    <p>
      A derivative of a function represented an account of how the
      function changes. The derivative was challenging to extend to
      scalar fields: new derivatives included partial derivatives,
      gradients and directional derivatives. The same is true for
      scalar fields. In this section, I'm going to introduce two
      important differential operators on vector fields. Each of them
      will capture something about how the vector field changes, but
      none of them is a simple, entire extention of the
      single-variable derivative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Differential operator on vector fields are defined via the
      <m>\nabla</m> operator defined in Calculus III. This was a
      vector of partial differential operators. Let me remind
      you what this operator looked like in two, three and <m>n</m>
      dimensions.

      So far, <m>\nabla</m> was used to define gradients. 
      If <m>f</m> is a scalar field, then the gradient <m>\nabla f</m>
      is a <em>vector field</em> describing the direction of greatest
      change. Now, however, I can define new operations on vector
      fields using <m>\nabla</m>. The first is an operation that uses
      the cross product, therefore is specific to <m>\RR^3</m>. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F : \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR^3</m> be a vector field.
          The <term>curl</term> of <m>F</m> is the 
          cross product of <m>\nabla</m> and <m>F</m>. Note that this
          outputs a new vector field, not a scalar field.

            \frac{\del F_3}{\del x}, \frac{\del F_2}{\del x} -
            \frac{\del F_1}{\del y}, \right)

      Curl measures the tendency of the vector field to cause
      <em>local</em> rotation. Using the fluid flow interpretation, if
      I drop an object in the fluid, it will flow along the integral
      curves of the vector field. However, as it flows along, it may
      also start spinning about an axis.  Curl measures the tendency
      of the vector field to cause such a spin. (This is very
      different from global rotation. The paths of rotation themselves
      may be circular without actually causing the object itself to
      spin. Likewise, the paths can be totally straight but still
      cause local rotation. Don't confusing curving with spinning.)
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A vector field with zero curl is called
          <term>irrotational</term>.

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider <m>F(x,y,z) = (y,0,0)</m>. This is a field which
          moves objects in the <m>x</m> direction, but the speed of
          movement varies with the <m>y</m> coordinate. The curl is
          <m>\nabla \times F = (0,0,-1)</m>. This field causes a
          clockwise rotation about the <m>z</m> axis; as particles in
          the fluid move in the <m>x</m> direction, they start
          spinning clockwise around a vertical axis.

          any dimension. The <term>divergence</term> of <m>F</m> is
          the dot product <m>\nabla \cdot F</m>. Note that this
          outputs a new scalar field, not a vector field.

      Divergence measure the tendency of a vector field to
      diffuse. Thinking in terms of gaseous fluids, a positive
      divergence at a point means that the density of the gas is
      <em>decreasing</em>. Some directions of flow may be inward and
      some outward, but there is a net diffusion of the gas. If the
      divergence is negative, the density is <em>increasing</em> and
      there is a net gathering of the gas.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A vector where where the divergence is zero is called
          <term>incompressible</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Many liquids are incompressible, at least locally and under
      reasonable energy circumstances. Water is usually treated as an
      incompressible fluid. The major difference in fluid dynamics
      between gases and liquid is compressibility. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Divergence allows for a reinterpretation of the Laplacian. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f</m> be is a scalar field <m>\RR^n \rightarrow
          \RR</m>. It's <term>Laplacian</term> is the divergence of
          its gradient: <m>\nabla \cdot (\nabla f) = \nabla^2 f</m>.
          Note that this outputs a scalar field.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The Laplacian was mentioned in the Calculus III, since the
      input and output are both scalar fields. However, the
      intermediate state (the gradient) is a vector field, and the
      second part of the operation (the divergence) is a vector
      operation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Laplacian is very important for many differential equations
      in physics. As the divergence of the gradient field, it
      measures where the scalar field leads to a gathering or
      diffusion. In a potential energy field, the Laplacian measures
      the sources (attractors) and repellors which generate the
      field.

    <title>Multivariable Differential Equations</title>
    <p>
      There were two important differential equations introduced in
      Calculus III: the heat equation and the wave equation.
      Extending these DES to several dimensions uses the Laplacian.
      Let me state the single-variabl eversions of the equation.

        x^2}

        \frac{\del^2 f}{\del t^2} \amp = \alpha \frac{\del^2 f}{\del

    <p>
      The single varialbe heat equation or wave equation describe heat
      profile or wave displacement along a one-dimensional object: a
      string, wire or rod, perhaps. However, heat profile can vary
      along a two or three dimension object, as can wave displacement.
      Therefore, it would be nice to have a multivariable version of
      these equations. The solution is quite simple: the second
      derivative simply becomes the Laplacian. The Laplacian measure
      that higher-dimensional analogue of concavity that cause heat
      diffusion/wave acceleration in the single variable case.

      In the wave equation, if <m>\nabla^2 f = 0</m> then
      <m>\frac{\del^2 f}{\del t^2} = 0</m>. Therefore, <m>f</m> has,
      at most, a linear dependence in <m>t</m>. Since the dependence
      in <m>x</m> is often sinusoidal, a common solution here is a
      standing wave or a wave with constant velocity. This (among
      other, more confusing reasons) leads to the terminology of
      harmonic functions.

      This proposition is a glimpse of a very general result in
      analysis. When starting with the right definitions, applying the
      same (or  asimilar) differential operator twice in a row should
      give the zero operator. Obviously, this isn't always true:
      partial derivatives certainly don't satisfy this, and even for
      <m>\nabla</m>, <m>\nabla \cdot \nabla f \neq 0</m> for a general
      scalar field. Near the end of these notes, I will give a
      general structure for understanding why differential operators
      should compose to zero. For now, know that these two results for
      <m>\nabla</m> are not a coincidence. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To finish this section, I'll give some examples of using these
      new differential operators. None of the calculations are new
      (I'm doing partial derivative, dot product and cross product),
      but it is still worth seeing how they all fit together in this
      new setting. It is also worth reviewing the interpretations of
      curl and gradient for these examples.

          Consider the vector field <m>F(x,y,z) = (-z,x,-y)</m>.
          <m>\nabla \times F = (-1,1,1)</m>, so the vector field
          causes the same local rotation at all points, about the axis
          <m>(-1,1,1)</m> (as a local axis direction). <m>\nabla
          \cdot F = (0,0,0)</m>, so the flow is incompressible. This
          is a good field to potentially model a liquid flow that
          induces a particular local rotation everywhere.

          <m>\nabla \times F = (0,0,0)</m>, so the field is
          irrotational. The divergence is <m>\nabla \cdot F = (2x
          +2y+2z)</m>. In the positive octant, the flow accelerates
          away from the origin, so the rate of difussion increases
          away from the origin. In other octants, we may have negative
          divergence, reflecting the fact that the local vector field
          directions are always positive.

          <m>\nabla \times F = (0,0,2)</m>, which shows the creation
          of local rotation about the <m>z</m> axis. Note that this is
          local rotation, which is seperate from the global rotation
          of the integral curves about the origin. Also, <m>\nabla
          \cdot F = 0</m>, so the flow is incompressible. Though the
          flow rotates in circles and causes ojects to spin as them
          move, it neither collects or diffuses anywhere.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the vector field <m>F(x,y,z) = (\sin x, \cos y,
          0)</m>. <m>\nabla \times F = (0,0,0)</m>, so the flow is
          irrotational. This is interesting, given the trigonometric
          functions; trigonometry might cause us to expect spinning.
          <m>\nabla \cdot F = \cos x - \sin y</m>, so there are
          various areas of diffusion and collection. The trigonometric
          term here causes diffusion/collection, not local rotation.

          \times F = \left(0,0, \frac{-1}{(x-y)^2} -
          \frac{-1}{(x+y)^2} \right)</m>: this curl is always negative
          and local rotation is always about the <m>z</m> axis.
          <m>\nabla \cdot F = \frac{-1}{(x+y)^2} +
          \frac{1}{(x-y)^2}</m>: therefore, <m>F</m> collects when
