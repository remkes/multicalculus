    <title>Characteristic Functions</title>
    <p>
      In single variable calculus, integrating over intervals is
      sufficient for basically any purpose. Even a more complicated
      subset of <m>\RR</m> for integration is almost certainly
      something that can be broken down into a number of intervals. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For multivariable integrals, the situation is very different.
      The domain of a scalar field can be any kind of strange subset
      of <m>\RR^n</m>, not necessarily the nice rectangles or
      rectangular prisms that are intervals. We may want to integrate
      over circular domains, or any kind of more complicated shapes.
      This section builds up the theory to understand such integrals:
      how to move from integration over intervals to integration over
      arbitrary domain in <m>\RR^n</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, not all domains are possible. I said <sq>arbitrary</sq>
      domains, but there are some restrictions. Some formal
      definitions are needed here.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>S</m> be a subset of <m>\RR^n</m>. The
          <term>characteristic function of <m>S</m></term> is defined as
          follows, where <m>v \in \RR^n</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \chi_S (v) : = \left\{ \begin{matrix} 1 \amp v \in S \\ 0
          \amp v \notin S \end{matrix} \right.
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The characteristic function is very simple: it has value <m>1</m>
      on the set <m>S</m> and <m>0</m> everywhere else. 
    </p>

      The characteristic function lets us make another formal
      definition. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>S</m> be a subset of <m>\RR^n</m> which is contained in
          an interval <m>I</m>. <m>S</m> is called a <term>integrable
          set</term> if the following integral exists.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_I \chi_S dV
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Almost all sets we will work with are integrable. Sets which are
      not integrable are very strange sets (at least, for doing anything
      geometric). The archetypical example is <m>\QQ \subset \RR</m>:
      <m>\QQ</m> is not an integrable subset of <m>\RR</m>. What does
      is mean, for a single variable function, to integrate over all
      rational points but not over the irrational points? Since the
      rational and irrational points are everywhere in <m>\RR</m>,
      there is no notion of <sq>area under a curve</sq> here at all.
      This integral doesn't make any sense; the set it not an
      integrable set. Equivalently, the Riemann integral limit doesn't
      not converges, since you can always choose rational or
      irrational <m>x_k^*</m>; the different choices lead to different
      values of the limit for these choices, so the integral doesn't
      work. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As I said, this is a formal definition. It won't be necessary to
      check integrability of the domain each time I do an integral.
      All reasonably geometric sets will be integrable. But the formal
      definition of an integrable set is necessary to give the the
      next formal definition. As with most formal definitions this is
      pretty useless for actual calculations.  We'll move on to
      calculations in <xref ref="section-variable-bounds" /> after we
      make the proper, formal definitions.

    <title>Integration over Integrable Sets</title>
    <p>
      Formally, let me now define how to integrate an integrable
      function over any integrable set.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>S</m> be a integrable subset of <m>\RR^n</m> with <m>S
          \subset I</m> for some interval <m>I</m>. Let <m>f: S
          \rightarrow \RR</m> be an integrable function which can be
          extended to an integrable function <m>\tilde{f}</m> on
          <m>I</m>. Then the integral of <m>f</m> over <m>S</m> is
          defined as:
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_S f dV \defeq \int_I \tilde{f} \chi_S dV
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The characteristic function removes all values of <m>f</m> outside
      the set <m>S</m>, so all that the integral measure are the values
      of <m>f</m> over <m>S</m>. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      I mentioned earlier that all open sets are integrable. I have
      another simplifying theorem that ensure we only need to integrate
      over open sets.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>S</m> be an integrable set in <m>\RR^n</m>. Let
          <m>S^0</m> be the set of interior points of <m>S</m>. Let
          <m>f: S \rightarrow \RR</m> be an integrable function. Then
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_S f dV = \int_{S^0} f dV
        </me>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      This proposition means that we can ignore any inconveniences which
      happen on the boundaries of sets. (Note that we still do need
      limits for improper integrals, when the value of a function
      approaches <m>\infty</m> near the boundary of a set). The
      proposition also means that sets which are essentially of lower
      dimensions do not matter in integration. If we are integrating
      over subsets of <m>\RR^3</m>, then integrating over points, line
      and planes amounts to nothing. Points, lines, and planes don't
      have any interior points in <m>\RR^3</m>, so we might as well be
      integrating over the empty set, which gives zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than ignoring boundaries and smaller dimensional pieces, our
      approach to general sets is to break them up into pieces. It is a
      general result in topology, which we won't get into here, that any
      (reasonable) set can be broken up in to pieces (possibly
      infinitely many) where the previous style of integral applies. We
      can also be creative: for example, we could integrate over a
      larger circle and subtract the integral over a small circle to
      integrate over a ring-shaped domain. In these various ways we can
      set up integrals over any (reasonable) subset of <m>\RR^n</m>.
