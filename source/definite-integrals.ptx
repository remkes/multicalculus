    <title>The Conceptual Integral</title>
    <p>
      The single-variable definite integral measured the area under the
      graph of a function. Multivariable functions also have graphs. 
      For a function of two variables, the graph is in
      <m>\RR^3</m> and there is volume under the grpah instead of area.
      For functions of three or more variables, the graphs are in higher
      dimensional spaces and enclose a hyper-volume. If the definite
      integral of a single variable function asked for the area under
      its graph, the definite integral for a multivariable integral
      should ask for the value of the volume or hyper-volume under its
      graph. This is, indeed, the case. 
    </p>

        <p>
          Let <m>U</m> be an subset of <m>\RR^n</m> and let
          <m>f: U \rightarrow \RR</m> be a function. The
          graph of <m>f</m> is a hypersurface in <m>\RR^{n+1}</m>
          lying over <m>U</m> (thought of as a subset of the copy of

        <p>
          is the volume or hypervolume under the graph of <m>f</m> in
          <m>\RR^{n+1}</m> (if such a volume or hypervolume can be
          defined). Like the single variable integral, (hyper)volume
          above the <m>x_{n+1} = 0</m> hyperplane is consider positive
          and (hyper)volume below is considered negative. The notation
          <m>dV</m> is used for functions of three or more variables,
          indicating the (hyper)volume in the domain. For functions of
          only two variables, the notation <m>dA</m> is used to
          represent the area in the domain. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Before moving on, I have a couple important notes to make about
      this definition. First, note that the function needs to be
      defined on the set <m>U</m>.  As with single variable integrals,
      I should always be aware of the domain of the function. If the
      function is undefined on some points in <m>U</m>, the integral
      will be undefined. If the function is undefined on the boundary
      of <m>U</m>, the volume may still be defined. This will be an
      extension of improper integrals, which I will discuss in <xref
      ref="subsection-improper-iterated-integrals" />.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also note that I said, in parenthesis, the integral is defined
      only if this volume is defined.  Note all functions will be
      integrable (indeed, not all single variable functions are
      integrable). Continuity will be enough to conclude this volume
      exists, but I will also investigate less restrictive conditions
      when I define the Riemann integral below.  In addition, not all
      subsets <m>U</m> allow for this volume to be defined. The
      definitions in <xref ref="section-iterated-integrals" />  will
      describe which sets <m>U</m> lead to well-defined volumes. For
      the integrals to be defined, both the function <m>f</m> and the
      subset<m>U</m> have to be reasonable. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, note that this is a very conceptual definition, but it
      is hard to work with. I will try to work towards a better
      definition that allows for calculation. I can't start with
      arbitrary domains <m>U</m>; I need to start with simpler
      domains: intervals.

          interval in <m>\RR^n</m>. Likewise, I can define various
          types of partially closed, partially open intervals by
          changing the inequalities (strict or non-strict) of the
          various endpoints of the single variable intervals in the
          product.

    <title>The Riemann Integral</title>

      Now I'm going to try to construct the definite integral extending
      the Riemann integral from single variable calculus. Recall that
      definition, noting that it was explicity defined for a function
      whose domain was an interval.

          <m>[a,b]</m> is the following limit (if it exists), where in
          the sum the interval is divided into <m>n</m> equal pieces and

          If the limit exists, the function is called
          <term>integrable</term>. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      I want to extend the pieces of this definition, now that I had
      defined the multivariable interval. 
      For the single-variable integral, I partitioned the interval into
      <m>n</m> pieces. I can also partition these multi-variable
      intervals. In general, there are several ways to do so; one of
      the easiest is simply to divide each of the single variable
      intervals into <m>k</m> pieces. In <m>\RR^2</m>, this splits the
      rectangle into a checkerboard pattern, with <m>k^2</m> small
      rectangles. In <m>\RR^3</m>, it splits into <m>k^3</m> small
      rectangular prisms. In <m>\RR^n</m> there are <m>k^n</m>
      subdivisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a partition of <m>I</m> into <m>k^n</m> pieces, I
      can use the same limit process as the single variable integral.
      Let <m>x^*</m> be any point in each piece of the partition and
      estimate the (hyper-)volume over that piece of the interval by a
      rectangular (hyper-)volume. The height is <m>f(x^*)</m>. The
      (hyper-) volume of one pieces of the approximation is this height
      multiplied by the size of the small partition pieces, in the
      appropriate dimension. I will write <m>\Delta V</m> for this
      size, thinking of <m>V</m> for volume or hypervolume. (As
      before, in the special case of two variables, I would write
      <m>\Delta A</m> instead).

          integral</term>  of a function is the following limit (if it
          exists), where the sum is taken over all <m>k^n</m>
          subdivision of the interval and <m>x_l^*</m> is any point in

      In the multivariable integral, the <m>\Delta V</m> becomes an

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-integrable-functions">
    <title>Integrable Functions</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="definition-definite-riemann-integral" />, I defined
      an integrable function, on an interval, to be a function such
      that the limit defining the Riemann integral exists. Most usual
      functions are integrable, particular functions defined on closed
      intervals so that they don't diverge near the edges of the
      interval. There is a whole theory of integrable functions.
      However, for the purposes of this course, I'm going to work with
      a slightly restricted class of functions. This won't affect any
      applications, since all the reasonable functions I want to use
      will still be in this category. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>I</m> be a closed interval in <m>\RR^n</m> and let
          <m>f: I \rightarrow \RR</m> be a function.  If I can break
          the interval <m>I</m> up into finitely many closed
          subintervals and if <m>f</m> is continuous on each of the
          closed subintervals, I say the function is <term>piecewise
          continuous</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The purpose of this definition is in the the following
      proposition. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          All piecewise continuous functions of several variables are
          integrable.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      As I said above, this is a convenience, since piecewise
      continuous is good enough for our purposes. 
      There are, in fact, other functions which are also integrable.
      Notice, also, that I defined this exlictly on closed intervals.
      Piecewise-continuous function on open intervals can have
      divergent behaviour (like vertical asymptote) at the edges of
      the intervals. These produce a multivariable version of
      improper integrals. I will consider these later, but insisting
      on functions defined on closed intervals ensure that I don't
      have problems like asymptotes at the edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an aside, there are also different notions of integrability
      and different definition of the integral. What I have discussed
      here is the Riemann integral, and this notion of integrability
      is Riemann-integrability. In higher mathematics, the most
      commonly used definition of the integral is a different
      definition, called the Lebesgue integral. It is also an
      approximation process, but it involve approximating the function
      with a special functions that only take finitely many values.
      The Lebesgue integral agrees with the Riemann integral on all
      Riemann-integrable functions.  However, there are functions
      where the Lebesgue integral is defined but the limit in the
      Riemann integral fails to converge.  It is interesting to
      observe that something as fundamental as the integral has
      multiple definitions and the choice of definitions has a real,
      measurable effect on our mathematics. A different kind of
      calculus course, one more interested in the mathematical
      foundations, would delve into the details of these different
      notions of the integral and integrebility.
