    <title>Describing Space</title>
    <p>
      The purpose of vectors is to describe the geometry of space. For
      the purposes of this course, I means two and three dimensional
      space, but many of the tools are more general and can describe
      higher dimensional spaces. That's very interesting for a more
      abstract treatment, but to do multivariable calculus, I need
      two and three dimensional vectors. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I imagine this is not your first exposure to vectors. However,
      this week is nevertheless important to review the main ideas as
      well as set our conventions for notation and terminology.
      Vectors are used in many places (linear algebra, physics,
      computer graphcis, engineering, among others) and most of those
      places have minor or even major differences in terms and
      notations. This review will get us all on the same page for the
      discussions through the course. So, let me start with the basic
      definitions. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In the context of geometry, ordinary numbers (integers, rational
          numbers or real numbers) are called <term>scalars</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>vector</term> is a finite ordered list of scalars.
          Vectors can be written either as columns or rows. If a
          vector is a list of the numbers <m>4</m>, <m>15</m>,
          <m>\pi</m> and <m>-e</m> (in that order), I write the
          vector in one of two ways:
          <md>
           <mrow>
             \amp \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 15 \\ \pi \\ -e \end{pmatrix} 
             \amp \text{or} \amp \amp (4, 15, \pi, -e) \amp
            </mrow>.
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If you have taken my linear algebra course, you will know that,
      in that course, I almost exclusively use column vectors. Here
      the convention is reversed: I will almost exclusively use row
      vectors. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer. <term>Real Euclidean
          Space</term> or <term>Cartesian Space</term>, written
          <m>\RR^n</m>, is the set of all vectors of length <m>n</m>
          with real number entries. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since there are <m>n</m> coefficieint in its vectors, the
          space <m>\RR^n</m> has <term>dimension</term> <m>n</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this course, I am exclusively interested in <m>\RR^2</m>
          (the familiar <term>Cartesian Plane</term>) and in
          <m>\RR^3</m> (which I will call <term>Cartesian
          Three-Space</term> or, more briefly, just <term>Cartesian
          Soace</term>). 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If I have a vector <m>(a,b)</m> in <m>\RR^2</m> or
          <m>(a,b,c)</m> in <m>\RR^3</m>, the scalars <m>a</m>,
          <m>b</m> and <m>c</m> are called the 
          <term>entries</term>, <term>coordinates</term> or
          <term>components</term> of that vector. Specifically,
          <m>a</m> is the first component, <m>b</m> is the second
          component and <m>c</m> is the third component. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The vector <m>(0,0)</m> in <m>\RR^2</m> and the vector
          <m>(0,0,0)</m> in <m>\RR^3</m> are called  the
          <term>origin</term> of each space. Each is also called the
          <term>zero vector</term>. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

      Euclidean space is visualized by drawing axes, one in each
      independent perpendicular direction. In this visualization, the
      vector <m>(a,b)</m> corresponds to the unique point I get moving
      <m>a</m> units in the direction of the <m>x</m> axis and
      <m>b</m> units in the direction of the <m>y</m> axis. <xref
      ref="figure-points-in-the-cartesian-plane" /> shows the location
      of several points in <m>\RR^2</m>.

      As with <m>\RR^2</m>, the point <m>(a,b,c)
      \in \RR^3</m> is the unique point I find by
      moving <m>a</m> units in the <m>x</m> direction, <m>b</m> units
      in the <m>y</m> direction and <m>c</m> units in the <m>z</m>
      direction. When visualizing <m>\RR^2</m>, the convention is to 
      draw the <m>x</m> axis horizontally, with a positive direction
      to the right, and the <m>y</m> axis vertically, with a positive
      direction upwards. For <m>\RR^3</m>, the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
      axes form a flat plane, and the <m>z</m> axis extends vertically
      from that plane as shown in <xref
      ref="figure-points-in-three-space" />.

      I can think of an element of <m>\RR^2</m>, say <m>(1,4)</m>, as
      both the point located at <m>(1,4</m> and the vector drawn from
      the origin to the point <m>(1,4)</m>, as shown in <xref
      ref="figure-points-and-directions" />. Though these two ideas
      are distinct, I will frequently switch between them, often
      without explicitly saying so. Part of becoming proficient in
      vector geometry is becoming accustomed to the switch between the
      perspectives of points and directions.

    <title>Local Direction Vectors</title>
    <p>
      I've already spoken about the distinction between elements of
      <m>\RR^n</m> as points and vectors. There is another important
      subtlety that shows up all throughout vector geometry. In
      addition to thinking of vectors as directions starting at the
      origin, I can think of them as directions starting anywhere in
      <m>\RR^n</m>. I call these <term>local direction vectors</term>.

          xaxis("$x$",Ticks("%"));
          yaxis("$y$",Ticks("%"));

          draw((0,0)--(2,2),Arrow); 
          draw((2,2)--(2,3),Arrow); 
          draw((2,2)--(3,2),Arrow); 

          label("$(2,2)$",(1,1),SE);
          label("Local $(1,0)$",(3,2),S);
          label("Local $(0,1)$",(2,3),E);
        </asymptote>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      <xref ref="figure-local-direction-vectors" /> shows local
      direction vectors starting at the point <m>(2,2) \in \RR^2</m>.
      The two local vectors <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(0,1)</m> are relative
      to the point <m>(2,2) \in \RR^2</m> as if that were their
      origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using vectors to define local directions is a useful tool. A
      standard example is a camera in a three-dimensional virtual
      environment. First, I need to know the location of the camera,
      which is an ordinary vector starting from the origin. Second, I
      need to know what direction the camera is pointing, which is a
      local direction vector which treats the camera location as the
      current origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most difficult things about learning vector geometry
      is becoming accustomed to local direction vectors. I won't
      always carefully distinguish between vectors at the origin and
      local direction vectors; often, the difference is implied, and it
      is up to the reader/student to figure out how the vectors are
      being used.
