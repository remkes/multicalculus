      First year calculus dealt with functions <m>\RR \rightarrow
      \RR</m>. Parametric curves dealt with functions <m>\RR
      \rightarrow \RR^n</m>. Multivariable functions are functions
      <m>\RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m>. They having an arbitrary number
      of inputs and outputs. I can distinguish between two main
      categories, classified by output.

      Vector fields are the most difficult and complicated, since
      they have both multiple inputs and multiple outputs. The study
      of vector fields will follow in a future section of this
      course. 
    </p>
    <example>

          There are many familiar scalar fields. The potential
          energy due to gravity on an object with mass <m>m</m> and
          height <m>h</m> above the surface of the earth is <m>PE =
          mgh</m> is a two variable function. In a circuit, voltage
          in terms of current and reisistance is <m>V = IR</m> is
          another two variable function. The force of gravity between
          two celestial object <m>F = -\frac{MmG}{r^2}</m> is a
          three-variable function which depends on both masses,
          <m>M</m> and <m>m</m>, as well as the distance between them
          <m>r</m>.  Any quantity which can vary in three dimensional
          space, such a pressure, temperature, humidity, is a function
          of the three variables of location <m>(x,y,z)</m>.

          Any other algebraic expression in <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>

      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>domain</term> of a scalar field <m>f: \RR^n
          \rightarrow \RR</m> is the subset of <m>\RR^n</m> where the
          function can be defined.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Domain has the same kind of restrictions as for single-variable
      functions: no division by zero, no negative even roots, no
      negative logarithms, etc. However, now domain
      restrictions may apply to any of the input variables. The
      domains themselves may be very complicated subsets of
      <m>\RR^n</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          I'll start with at the domains of the five functions in
          <xref ref="example-multivariable1" />.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f_1</m> and <m>f_4</m> are polynomials (in two
                variables), so there are no restrictions. Their
                domain is <m>\RR^2</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f_2</m> is a sine function, which again imposes no
                restrictions, so it also has domain <m>\RR^2</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f_5</m> has two square roots, one involving
                <m>x</m> and one involving <m>y</m>. Therefore,
                <m>x\geq 0</m> and <m>y \geq 0</m> are necessary to
                define <m>f_5</m>. That domain is the positive
                <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> quadrant, including the origin
                and the positive pieces of both axes.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>f_6</m> also has a square root. To ensure that the
                square root has a positive argument, I require <m>4 -
                x^2 - y^2 \geq 0</m>, or <m>x^2 + y^2 \leq 4</m>.
                This domain is a a circular disc of radius <m>2</m>,
                including its boundary.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Lastly, <m>f_3</m>, has an strange exponential. This
                leads to very strange domain behaviour. If <m>y</m>
                is a positive integer, <m>x</m> can be any real
                number. If <m>y</m> is a negative integer or 0, then
                <m>x</m> can be any real number except 0. If <m>y</m>
                is a fraction, <m>x</m> must be positive if the
                denominator of <m>y</m> is even, to avoid square roots
                of negative numbers. If <m>y</m> is irrational,
                <m>x</m> must be positive. This all leads to a very
                complicated domain in <m>\RR^2</m>, something
                impossible to describe directly as a shape.

    <title>Geometry and Graphs of Functions</title>
    <p>
      The graph of a single variable <m>f: \RR \rightarrow \RR</m> was
      a curve in <m>\RR^2</m> where one axis was input and one axis
      was output. The idea generalizes, but in all cases, a graph has
      to show both the inputs and output.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>A \subset \RR^n</m> be the domain of a scalar
          field <m>f: A \rightarrow \RR</m>. The
          <term>graph</term> of the scalar field is the subset of
          <m>\RR^{n+1}</m> consisting of all points <m>(x_1, x_2,
          \ldots, x_n, f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n))</m> for <m>(x_1, x_2,
          \ldots x_n) \in A</m>.

    <p>
      Since the graph must show inputs and outputs, it need many
      dimensions. If <m>n \geq 3</m>, then the graph is in
      <m>\RR^4</m> or some other higher dimensional space. I can only
      actually see graphs of scalar field on <m>\RR^2</m>.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The <m>\RR^2</m> case is useful to understand the general
      situation. In this case, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are inputs
      (domain) and <m>z</m> is the output (range). I can think of
      the graph as a height function: over some point <m>(x,y)</m> in
      the domain of <m>f</m>, the graph sits at some height <m>z =
      f(x,y)</m>.

      I used graphs extensively in single-variable calculus to
      understand derivatives and integrals: derivative were slopes of
      tangent lines and integrals were area under curves. I want to
      generalize this to the new higher-dimensional graphs. For
      scalar fields <m>f:\RR^2 \rightarrow \RR</m>, it's not too difficult
      to extend the notions. Instead of tangent line, the graph will
      now have a <em>tangent plane</em>. Instead of area under the
      curve, a graph has volume under the surface. For <m>f: \RR^n
      \rightarrow \RR</m>, the extension of the idea is more
      geometrically difficult. There are now tangent n-spaces and
      (n+1)-hyper-volumes under the n-dimensions graph surface.

      As an alternative to conventional graphs of function, a nice way
      to visualize height functions is as topological maps. These 
      visualizations are called contour plots.

          Let <m>f: A \rightarrow \RR</m> be a scalar field for a
          domain <m>A \subset \RR^2</m>. A <term>contour plot</term>
          for <m>f</m> is a plot of curves in <m>\RR^2</m> where each
          curve is a locus of the form <m>f(x,y) = c</m> for some

    <p>
      A contour plot has a series of implicit curves at constant
      elevation; the constants <m>c</m> are the elevation. It shows
      curves where the function takes a specific value. By looking at
      the relationships of the curves, I can intuit how the function
      behaves.

          has a simple hill at the origin and slopes down in all
          directions. The contours are loci of the form

          as <m>\frac{5}{c} - 1 = x^2 + y^2</m>. These contours are

      a great deal about the behaviour of the function. Level sets
