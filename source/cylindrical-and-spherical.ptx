    <p>
      Polar coordinates was the most important change of variables in
      <m>\RR^2</m>. In <m>\RR^3</m>, there are two extremely useful
      changes of coordinates: cylindrical and sphereical coordinates.
      This section will review the definitions of these coordinate
      systems and give exmaples where they are used to solve multiple
      integrals.

      Before I move on, I want to define a term for these three
      coordinate system (and other similar systems). All three of
      these coordinate systems are based around circle. Their utility
      comes from this; cartesian coordinates are not really good for
      anything with a circular structure. In cartesian coordinates,
      circles and spheres inevitably lead to annoying square roots in
      the calculations. These other coordinate systems simplify those
      calculations substantially. I want to use the fact that all of
      these systems involve circles (and thus angle and radii) to
      define a term that unites them.

        A coordinate system for <m>\RR^n</m> where at least one of the
        coordinates is an angle and at least one of the coordinates is
        a radius is called a <term>curvilinear coordinate
        syste</term>. By contrast, cartesian coordinates are often
        referred to as a <term>rectangular coordinate system</term>.

      Cylindrical coordinates leave <m>z</m> unchanges and use polar
      coordinates in the <m>xy</m>-plane. Here are the transformation.
      As before, the typical way to write the transformation is
      treating the cartesian variables as the dependent variables, the
      output.

      Like with polar coordinates, it is useful to know the shapes
      give by setting one of the three coordinates to a constant. The
      locus of <m>r=c</m> is a cylinder of radius <m>c</m> around the
      <m>z</m> axis. The cylinder extends infinitely in the positive
      and negative <m>z</m> axis. This cylinder is the source of the
      names of the system and, indeed, if it the easiest system to
      describe or integration over a cylinder. The locus of <m>\theta
      = c</m> is a halfplace extending out from the <m>z</m> axis; all
      points which have a particular angle in the <m>xy</m> plane.
      Finally, <m>z=c</m> is a horizontal plane at a fixed height
      <m>c</m>. This is the same as cartesian coordinates, since the
      <m>z</m> of cylindrical and the <m>z</m> of cartesian
      coordinates are excatly the same. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To describe a solid cylinder of radius <m>3</m> which starts at
      the <m>xy</m> plane and stops at neight <m>z = 5</m>, I can use
      constant bounds in each variable: <m>r \in [0,3]</m>, <m>\theta
      \in [0,2\pi]</m> and <m>z \in 0,5</m>. Many other objects that
      have some kind of cylindrical symmetry, or even just circular
      cross-sectiosn along the <m>z</m> axis, can be conveniently
      describe with cylindrical coordinates.

          This example it quite a tricky volume problem, but shows
          some clever use of polar coordinates. 
          Assume there are three cylinders of radius <m>R</m> along
          each axis in <m>\RR^3</m>. What is the volume of the
          intersection of all three cylinders? (This object is called the
          tricylinder Steinmetz solid). Setting up the geometry is
          difficult. I will integrate a volume over the <m>xy</m>
          plane. By symmetry, I can work with one 16th of the
          shape: the portion that lies above one 8th of the circle
          above the axis. The first 8th of the circle is described by
          the bounds <m>\theta \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{4} \right]</m>
          in cylindrical coordinates. The <m>z</m>-axis cylinder
          restricts the shape to the circle in the
          <m>xy</m>-plane and the <m>x</m>-axis cylinder is lower than
          the <m>y</m>-axis cylinder over this particular <m>8th</m>
          or a circle, so the <m>x</m>-axis cylinder is the limit on
          height. What is that height function? The equation of the
          cylinder is <m>y^2 + z^2 = R^2</m>. I can solve for <m>z</m> 
          to get  <m>z ^2 = R^2 - y^2 = R^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta</m>,
          writing <m>y</m> in cylindrical coordinates. This determines
          a region of integration. I integrate constant <m>1</m> and I
          remember to include the Jacobian.

    <title>Spherical Coordinates</title>
    <p>
      Cylindrical coordinates are very close to polar coordinates: I
      just added the ordinary <m>z</m> from cartesian coordinates to
      the existing <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m> of polar coordiantes. The
      fundamental shape is a cylinder around the <m>z</m> axis, any
      cross section of which is a circle. The radius term is the
      radius of this circle around the <m>z</m> axis. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Spherical coordinates are more novel. Instead of using polar
      coordinates and circles, I now start with the sphere. The
      coordinate <m>r</m>, instead of being the radius of a circle,
      will now be the distance from the point to the origin.
      Equivalently, <m>r</m> is the radius of the sphere, centred at
      the origin, which contains the point. Once a sphere has been
      identified, I need to use the other two coordinates to specify
      which point on this sphere. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The system to identify points of a sphere is very similar to
      latitude and longitude; the reference points just different. I
      am going to defined two angles: <m>\theta</m> and <m>\phi</m>.
      The <m>\theta</m> angle will be the equivalent of longitute.
      Starting from the positive <m>x</m> axis and moving
      counterclockwise, <m>\theta</m> indicates an arc on the sphere
      from the <sq>north pole</sq> to the <sq>south pole</sq>. This is
      essentially longitude, just instead of going from <m>-180</m> to
      <m>180</m>, using radius the range is <m>[0, 2\pi]</m>.
      Finally, the second angle is something I will call colatitutde.
      This is, again, essentially latitude, but <m>0</m> is now at the
      north poth. The range here is only <m>\phi \in [0,\pi)</m>,
      since after <m>\pi</m> radians, I am already at the south pole
      of the sphere.

      Notice that the Jacobian has <m>r^2</m>, so units of
      area. As with polar coordinates, this corrects the units in
      the infinitesimal expression <m>dr d\theta d\phi</m>. With two
      angles, the infinitesimal expression only has unit of length.
      Mutiplying by the Jacobian produces units of volume, as we
      expect for this infinitesimal in <m>\RR^2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with the other curvilinear coordinates, I'm interesting in
      the loci described by setting each coordinate to a constant. The
      most important of these is <m>r =c</m>, which describes a sphere
      of radius <m>c</m>; I already used this in the definition and
      this is what gives the coordinates their name. Setting
      longitutde to be constant (but allowing any radius and any
      lattitude) gives a halfplane going out from the <m>z</m> axis,
      must like with cylindrical coordiantes. Setting the colatitude
      to be constant (but allowing any radius and any longitute)
      produces a cone. The cone expands upwards if the latitute is
      less than <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and expands downwards if the
      latitude is greater than <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>. The special case
      of <m>\phi = \frac{\pi}{2}</m> (which corresponds to points of
      the equators of each sphere) gives the <m>xy</m> plane.

          The easiest example is calculating volume of a sphere of
          radius <m>R</m>. The bounds are all constant: <m>r \in
          [0,R</m>, <m>\theta \in [0,2\pi]</m> and <m>\phi \in
          [0,\pi]</m>. This describes any longitude, an colatitude,
          and all radii up to <m>R</m>, thus giving the solid sphere.
          Since this is volume, the integrand is <m>1</m>. I must also
          remember the Jacobian.

        <p>
          Consider a sphere of radius <m>R</m>. Inside this sphere is
          a cone with flare angle <m>\frac{\pi}{6}</m>, where the tip of the
          cone is located at very bottom of the sphere and the cone
          opens up inside the sphere. The cone, plus the portion of
          the sphere above the cone, gives a shape that is something
          like an ice-cream cone; it's a cone plus a spherically
          curved cap at the top of the cone. What is the volume of
          this object?
        </p>
        <p>
          If I put the centre of the sphere at <m>(0,0,R)</m>, then
          the vertex of the cone can be put at the origin. The
          equation of such a sphere is
        </p>
        <me>
          x^2+ y^2 + (z-R)^2 = R^2
        </me>.
        <p>
          Since <m>r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2</m>, this equation simplifies
          into <m>r^2 = 2 R z</m> which is <m>r^2 = 2Rr\cos \phi</m>
          or <m>r = 2R\cos \phi</m>. This can be taken at the outside
          bound of the radius term, as <m>\phi \in \left[0,
          \frac{\pi}{2} \right]</m> and
          <m>\theta \in [0, 2\pi]</m>. The flare of the cone is
          <m>\frac{\pi}{6}</m>, which restricts <m>\phi \in \left[0,
          \frac{\pi}{6} \right]</m>.
          I integrate with these bounds for the volume, making sure
          that <m>r</m> is an inside integral since its bounds depend
          on <m>\theta</m>. Since this is volume, the integrand is
          <m>1</m>. I need to remember the Jacobian.
