    <title>Definition</title>
    <p>
      A major goal of this course is extending the notion of the
      derivative to multivariable functions. For parametric curves,
      the previous idea of the derivative (measuring the slope of a
      tangent line) became the tangent vector instead. For scalar
      fields which depend on multiple inputs, the extension of the
      derivative is more difficult. In this and the following
      sections, I'm going to introduce a variety of different ways to
      extend the derivative, each trying to capture some aspect of the
      single variable derivative. The first extention is the partial
      derivative.
      
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> be a scalar field.
          If <m>x</m> is one of the variables, then the derivative of
          <m>f</m> which pretends that all other variables are constant
          is called the <term>partial derivative</term> of <m>f</m> in
          the variable <m>x</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The notation for partial derivatives resembles Leibniz notation
      for ordinary derivatives: <m>\frac{df}{dx}</m>. Leibniz style
      notation is useful since the variable of differentiation is
      explicit. The partial derivatives of <m>f</m> in terms of
      <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>, or <m>x_i</m> are written with a
      stylized version of <m>d</m> in Leibniz notation.
      <md><mrow>
        \amp \frac{\del f}{\del x} \amp \amp \frac{\del f}{\del y}
        \amp \amp \frac{\del f}{\del z} \amp \amp \frac{\del f}{\del
        x_i}
      </mrow></md>
    </p>
    <p>
      For interpretation, the partial derivative gives the rate of
      change of <m>f</m> with respect to one of its variables. There
      isn't a holisitic notion of rate of change, but this definitions
      hows how a function changes in each variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we wanted to be formal, pretending that all the other
      variales are constant is the same as taking limits in one
      variable. For <m>f: \RR^2 \rightarrow \RR</m>, these limits
      defined the two partial derivatives.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          \frac{\del f}{\del x} (a,b) \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow
          0} \frac{ f(a+h, b) - f(a,b)}{h}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          \frac{\del f}{\del y} (a,b) \amp = \lim_{h \rightarrow
          0} \frac{ f(a, b+h) - f(a,b)}{h}
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the value of <m>\frac{\del f}{\del x}</m> still
      depends on the value of the coordinate <m>y</m>. Different
      <m>y</m> values identify different points in the domain, where
      the rate of change with respect to <m>x</m> may differ. The
      partial derivative pretends that <m>y</m> is constant, but the
      value of that constant can have an effect on the partial
      derivative. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As was the case for single-variable calculus, I use
      <m>\frac{\del}{\del x}</m> and similar expressions as operators
      <mdash/> the things that take derivatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are various notational conventions for partial
      derivatives. In addition to <m>\frac{\del f}{\del x}</m>, I
      can also write this as <m>f_x</m>, <m>\del_x f</m> and <m>D_x
      f</m>. The first of these is a nice short-hand which I will
      use frequently.

          single-variable derivatives.

    <title>Differentiability</title>
    <p>
      The partial derivative allows me to define a holistic notion of
      the differentiability of a scalar field.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> is
          <term>differentiable</term> at
          <m>(a_1, a_2, \ldots,
          a_n)</m> if <term>all</term> of its partial derivatives
          <m>\frac{\del f}{\del x_i}</m> exist at that point.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In this sense, the partial derivatives will be the building
      blocks of all the various extensions of the single-variable
      derivative to scalar fields. If all the partial derivatives
      exists, then any extension of the derivative will work. All of
      the other extensions I define can be expressed in terms of the
      partial derivatives. One could consider the collection of all
      partial derivatives as <sq>the derivative</sq> of a scalar field
      (though I will eventually argue that other extensions have a
      better claim to the term). 
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-clairaut">
    <title>Higher Partial Derivatives and Clairaut's Theorem</title>
    <p>
      Like the ordinary single variable derivative, I can iterate
      partial derivatives to get higher derivatives. First, I can
      iterate the same partial derivative, with the pretense that the
      other variables are constant. If <m>f</m> involves any of the
      variablse <m>x, y, z</m> or <m>x_i</m>, then here are the second
      partials. 
      <md><mrow>
        \amp \frac{\del^2 f}{\del x^2} \amp \amp \frac{\del^2 f}{\del
        y^2} \amp \amp \frac{\del^2 f}{\del z^2} \amp \amp
        \frac{\del^2 f}{\del x_i^2}
      </mrow></md>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I can also iterate partial derivatives in different
      variables. Consider a function of two variables <m>f(x,y)</m>. I
      can pretend <m>x</m> is constant and take the derivative in
      <m>y</m>. Then, having done that, I can switch and present
      <m>y</m> is constant to take the derivative in <m>x</m>. This is
      called a mixed partial and is written with the following notation.
      <me>
        \frac{\del^2 f}{\del x \del y}
      </me>
      In the denominator of this notation, <m>\del x \del y</m>, the
      derivative in <m>y</m> happens first and the derivative in
      <m>x</m> happens second. This is like the right-to-left notation
      for functions. This notation (hopefully) makes sense in terms of 
      of differential operators. An operator acts on functions on the
      left, so the piece closest to the function (the <m>y</m>
      derivative in this case) happens first. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I can iterate this as many times as I want. If I have a function
      of three variables, <m>f(x,y,z)</m>, consider this mixed
      partial.
      <me>
        \frac{\del^4 f}{\del x \del y \del z \del y}
      </me>
      In this partial, I differentiate first in <m>y</m>, then in
      <m>z</m>, then in <m>y</m> again, and finally in <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a useful piece of notation to refer to the
      differentiability of multivariables functions.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        Let <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> be a scalar field. Then
        <m>f</m> is in the class <m>C^n</m> is all of its
        degree <m>n</m> partial derivatives (both pure and mixed)
        exist and are continuous. This property is often written<m>f
        \in C^n</m>. If I want to specify the domain, say some subset
        <m>A \subset \RR^n</m>, I can write <m>f \in C^n(A)</m>,
        meaning that all the partial derivatives of degree <m>n</m>
        exist over that domain. If the function is infinitely
        differentiable, this notation becomes <m>f \in
        C^{\infty}</m>.

          Curiously, I get the same answer from either order of the

      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The situation in the previous example was not a coincidence.
      There is a very useful theorem for calculating mixed partial
      derivativaes.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <emph>(Clairaut's Theorem)</emph> Let <m>A \subset \RR^n</m>
          be an open subset. Let <m>f(x_1, \ldots x_n)</m> be a
          function <m>A \rightarrow \RR</m> and let <m>x_i</m> and
          <m>x_j</m> represent any two of the <m>n</m> variables. If
          <m>f \in C^2(A)</m> (that is, all the second partial
          derivatives of <m>f</m> exist and are continuous an the  pen
          set <m>A</m>), then <m>f_{x_ix_j} = f_{x_jx_ix}</m> on that
          set. Informally. for <m>C^2</m> function, I can do mixed
          second partial derivatives in any order. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      All of our elementary functions (polynomials, roots,
      exponentials, etc) will have this property of having continuous
      second derivative. That means for most usual functions, I can be
      flexible in the order in which I calculate mixed partials. This
      flexibility is over very useful, since partial derivatives in
      one variable might be much easier to calculate than partials in
      a different variable.
