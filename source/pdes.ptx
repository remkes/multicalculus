      Now that I have defined partial derivatives, I can introduce
      what is possibly the most important setting for their use:
      partial differential equations. I will start with two classic
      examples. The first is diffusion of heat (though the same
      principle apply to any kind of diffusion model). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Assume there is a 1-dimensional rod where length is measured
      with the variable <m>x</m>. Heat can vary along the rod, so I
      measure it by a function <m>u(x)</m>. However, this
      distribution of heat can also change over time. Therefore, I
      should measure the heat distribution both in terms of position
      <m>x</m> along the rod and time <m>t</m>, <m>u(x,t)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need to consider several aspects of the situation to give a
      full account of how heat will diffuse. First, I will look at the
      mechanics of heat. I make the assumption that heat wants to
      equalize; with the absence of external addition of heat, it will
      diffuse until it equals out everywhere. If addition, I assume
      that the greater the variance in heat between two adjacent
      points on the rod, the faster the heat will diffuse. How do I
      translate this assumptions into mathematics? I need to get a
      measure of this variance in heat. The measure is local, since
      heat only diffuses to points adjacent. So how do I measure 
      the local variance in heat?
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the heat picture at some fixed time <m>t_0</m>:
      <m>u(x,t_0)</m>. It is not the value of the heat that
      determines diffusion, since nearby values can be higher or
      lower. It is also not the slope of this graph in <m>x</m> that
      determines the diffusion, since a straight line slope represents
      and even flow of heat from one end to the other. Instead, 
      heat wants to return to this even flow, this straight line:
      so it is the curvature of the graph that disrupts the straight
      line. Curvature or concavity is measured by the second
      derivative. Therefore <m>u_{xx}(x,t_0)</m> measures the
      tendency for the heat to diffuse. <xref
      ref="figure-concavity-heat">Figure</xref> illustrates how
      concavity causes heat diffusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diffusion creates change: heat will leave or enter the point.
      Change is measured by the time derivative <m>u_t(x,t)</m>. So
      concavity, the second space deriavitve, must be related to the
      first time derivative. What is the relationship between these?
      The simpliest relationship is a linear relationship. That means
      there is a constant <m>\alpha</m> such that
      <me>
        \frac{\del u}{\del t} = \alpha \frac{\del^2 u}{\del x^2}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This equation is called the Heat Equation. Though relatively
      simple, it is one of the most important partial differential
      equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equation, however, isn't enough to solve the problem. I
      also need boundary conditions and initial conditions. The
      boundary conditions determine what happens at the end of the rod:
      <m>u(0,t)</m> and <m>u(l,t)</m>. In principle, these could be
      anything functions of <m>t</m>. For now, I will assume they are
      constant <m>u(0,t) = a</m> and <m>u(l,t) = b</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also need intial conditions. Initial conditions determine the
      starting heat distribution at at particular time, say
      <m>t=0</m>, That is <m>u(x,0) = f(x)</m>, a single variable
      function that shows the original situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All together, this information determines the physical system.
      I can then try to find a function <m>u(x,t)</m> which matches
      the equation, the boundary conditions and the initial
      conditions. Such a task is often very difficult to do.
      However, if both boundary conditions are constant <m>0</m> and
      the initial condition is <m>f(x) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi x}{l}
      \right)</m> then the function
      <me>
        u(x,t) = e^{-\frac{\alpha \pi^2 t}{l^2}} \sin \left( \frac{\pi
        x}{l} \right)
      </me>
      solves the partial differential equation. This is an ideal
      case: in general the solutions become much more complicated.
      This initial heat distribution is half a period of a sine wave,
      and the time dependence is a exponential decay of the amplitude
      of that sine wave back towards a stable 0-level heat
      distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      This example is archtypical of many partial differential
      equations. There will almost always be a function which depends
      on time as well as some other quantities. In physics, these
      other quantities are usually position. Then the equation is
      usually organized by taking a time derivative on one side and a
      position derivative on the other. Then the equation encodes a
      relationship between the two two derivatives. In addition,
      boundary conditions determine what happens at the edges of our
      environment and initial conditions describe  the situation at a
      fixed moment in time. Finally, I try to find a multi-variable
      function that fits all the information.
    </p>

    <title>The Wave Equation</title>
    <p>
      Another very familiar situation is a wave moving through an
      elastic medium. If there is a 1-dimensional elastic medium
      (think a wire or string), then <m>u(x,t)</m> measures the
      displacement of the medium at position <m>x</m> and time
      <m>t</m>. The physical motivation is similar to the heat
      equation: the concavity measure the offset of the stiuation from
      a stable straight line. However, this concavity, instead of
      causing heat diffusion, causes acceleration on the adjacent
      points of the elastic medium. The elastic medium doesn't
      diffuse back to equilibrium, it accelerates, like a spring, back
      to equilibrium. Acceleration is a second time derivative, so
      the Wave Equation is
      <me>
        \frac{\del^2 u}{\del t^2} = \alpha \frac{\del^2 u}{\del x^2}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, there are boundary conditions and initial condition and,
      in general, the problem is very difficult to solve. However, if
      I choose the same simplistic options as I did with the heat
      equation, with constant zero boundary conditions at <m>x=0</m>
      and <m>x=l</m> and initial wave profile <m>f(x) = \sin \left(
      \frac{ \pi x}{l} \right)</m>, then the solution is
      <me>
        u(x,t) = \sin \left( \frac{\sqrt{\alpha} \pi t}{l} \right)
        \sin \left( \frac{\pi x}{l} \right)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, instead of decay to equilibrium, there is an oscillating
      amplitude, resulting is a very simple standing wave on the wire
      or string. This is a very simple version: there are no higher
      harmonics and there is no friction which causes decay over
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without friction, the oscillations of the wave equation continue
      forever while the heat diffusion in the heat equation quickly
      decayed to equilibrium. The major difference between the two
      equations is one of active versus passive response. In the heat
      equation, the time derivative is a first derivative: the
      velocity is determined by the physical arrangement. This is a
      passive situation: some velocity is simply determined by the
      arrangement. It fades away over time. In the wave equation, the
      time derivative is a second derivative: the acceleration is
      determined by the physical arrangmeent. This is an active
      situation: the acceleration can increase the velociy of the
      displacement. The result is propogation of waves, an active
      process, and it will continue until otherwise damped by
      friction.

    <p>
      Many other famous equations are relationships between times
      derivatives and position derivatives. In both of the following
      examples, the left side is a time derivative and the right is a
      space derivative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Schrodinger equation is the centre of quantum mechanics: it
      measures a wave function <m>\Psi(x,y,z,t)</m> in three
      dimensions and time. The symbol <m>\nabla</m> is a
      3-dimemsional differential operator which will be defined in
      <xref ref="subsection-gradient-extensions" />;
      for now, just know that it is a combination of position
      derivatives. <m>\hbar</m> is a constant, <m>\imath</m> is a
      number with <m>\imath^2 = -1</m>, <m>m</m> is mass and
      <m>V(x,y,z)</m> is a potential energy function. 
      <me> 
        \imath \hbar \frac{\del \Psi}{\del t} = - \frac{ \hbar^2}{2m}
        \nabla^2 \Psi + V \Psi
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Another famous example is the Navier-Stokes equation, which is
      the fundamental equation of fluid dynamics. There are a number
      of versions of it, but I'll only write one. The function
      <m>v(x,y,z,t)</m> is the flow velocity of a three-dimensional
      fluid. Again, <m>\nabla</m> is a 3-dimensional position
      differential operator. <m>\rho</m> is the fluid density,
      <m>p</m> is the pressure, <m>T</m> is something called a stress
      tensor and <m>f</m> is an external force of the fluid. The
      equation is
      <me>
        \rho \frac{\del v}{\del t} = \rho v \cdot \nabla v - \nabla p
        + \nabla \cdot T + f
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Solving the Navier-Stokes equation for various initial and
      boundary conditions is the subject of a whole branch of
      mathematical physics called fluid dynamics.
