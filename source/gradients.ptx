    <title>Definition of the Gradient</title>
    <p>
      After partial derivatives, I want to proceed to define several
      other generalizations of the derivative. The first is the
      gradient.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The gradient of a function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m>
          is written <m>\nabla f</m> and defined as
          <me>
            \nabla f = \left( \frac{\del f}{\del x_1}, \frac{\del
            f}{\del x_2}, \ldots, \frac{\del f}{\del x_n} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The gradient is a new function <m>\RR^n \rightarrow \RR^n</m>.
      It ouputs the <em>vector</em> of partial derivatives of <m>f</m>
      at any point in its domin. Note that the gradient is a local
      direction vector <em>in the domain</em>.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-gradient-interpretation">
    <title>Interpretation of the Gradient</title>
    <p>
      The best interpretation of the gradient comes from contour
      plots. Like the gradient, countour plots live in <m>\RR^n</m>,
      the domain, and show the level (hyper)surfaces of the function.
      If, as in <m>\RR^2</m>, I interpret the function as a height
      function and the countour plot as a topographical map, the
      gradient shows direction of greatest increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we draw topographical lines on a countour plot, the gradient
      will always be locally perpendicular to those lines and will
      point in the direction of greatest increase. Rephrased, this is
      a useful result: <m>\nabla f</m> is always the normal to the
      level sets of <m>f</m>. If those level sets are hypersurfaces,
      their tangent (hyper)planes can be determined by the normal
      <m>\nabla f</m>.

    <title>Gradient Examples</title>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A central example of gradients is found by considering the
          gravitational potential energy function caused by a mass
          <m>M</m> at the the origin. Another object of mass <m>m</m>
          and position <m>(x,y,z)</m> has potential gravitational
          energy of
          <me>
            P = \frac{-GmM}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 +z^2}}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          By convention, this potential energy is negative. It
          approaches <m>-\infty</m> in the limit at the origin, and
          approaches <m>0</m> as the distance from the origin grows to
          <m>\infty</m>. I'll writ the gradient of this potential
          energy; I seperate it into two pieces, one of magnitude and
          one of diection (where direction is given by a unit vector). 
          <me>
            \nabla P = \frac{GmM}{\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 +z^2)^3}} (x, y, z)
            = \frac{GmM}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 +
            z^2}} (x,y,z)
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is precisely the force of gravity. The gradient points
          in the direction of maximum increase in potential energy
          (directly outward from the origin) with magnitude
          <m>\frac{GmM}{r^2}</m> where <m>r</m> is the distance
          between the two objects. This is a common situation we will
          discuss in Calculus IV: many forces are the result of
          gradients of potential energy functions. These forces are
          called <term>conservative forces</term>. Gravity, like
          these other forces, can be thought of as the tendency for
          objects to lower their potential energy as efficiently as
          possible.

          In another example, consider a function <m>p(x,y,z)</m>
          which measures the pressure in a rotating cylindrial drum.
          (Think of a centrifuge). With bounds <m>z \in [0,5]</m> and
          <m>x,y \in [0, \sqrt{3}]</m>, the function is
          <me>
            p(x,y,z) = \frac{1}{z+1} (x^2 + y^2)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          The gradient is
          <me>
            \nabla p(x,y,z) = \left( \frac{2x}{z+1}, \frac{2y}{z+1},
            \frac{-(x^2 + y^2)}{(z+1)^2} \right)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This points in the direction of greatest increase in
          pressure. It is perpendicular to the surfaces of constant
          pressure. If there is a difference in media in the drum,
          the lighter medium will be force towards the edges of the
          drum in the direction of this gradient.

      In addition to the gradient, <m>\nabla</m> itself is the
      following differential operator.
      <me>
        \nabla = \left( \frac{\del}{\del x_1}, \frac{\del}{\del x_2},
        \frac{\del}{\del x_3}, \ldots, \frac{\del}{\del x_n} \right)

      This is a vector-valued differential operator: it outputs the
      vector of partial derivatives <m>\nabla f</m>. Now that I have
      defined this operator, there are other operations I can use it
      for.  Most of those operations come in Calculus IV, but I can
      define one such operation here.

          If <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow R</m> is a scalar function, the
          <term>Laplacian</term> of <m>f</m> is given by applying
          <m>\nabla</m> twice. Since <m>\nabla</m> outputs a vector,
          the second application uses the dot product to output a
          scalar.

      The Laplacian, as a second derivative, measure some kind of
      multi-dimensional concavity. I considered the heat equation in
      one dimension; in that equation, concavity measured local
      displacement from equilibrium. The Laplacian does the same in
      multiple dimensions. The general Heat Equation is
      <me>
        \frac{\del u}{\del t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u
      </me>.
    </p>

      Similarly, the general Wave Equation is
      <me>
        \frac{\del^2 u}{\del t^2} = \alpha \nabla^2 u
      </me>.
