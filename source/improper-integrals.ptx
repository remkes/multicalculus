    <title>Improper Integrals</title>
    <p>
      An function defined on a closed interval has to include values
      on the boundary of the interval. Assuming the function is
      piecewise continuous (as if the habit in this course), this
      means that the function cannot diverge to infinity near the edge
      of the interval. However, an function which is only defined on
      an open interval can have any kind of behaviour near the
      boundaries, including diverging to infinity. I would like to be
      able to handle this kind of integral as well
    </p>
    <p>
      In single variable calculus, we used improper integrals to deal
      with functions with problematic behaviour near the boundary of
      an interval. Thankfully, this translates nicely to iterated
      integrals. If a function diverges to infinity near the edge of
      an interval, then at least one piece of the iterated integral
      (and perhaps more than one piece) will be a single-variable
      improper integral. We approach these as we did in single
      variable integration: with limits approaching the problematic
      endpoint(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a function <m>f: (0,1] \times (0,1] \rightarrow \RR</m>
      that diverged to infinity when <m>x \rightarrow 0</m>. Here is
      the iterated integral.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_I f(x,y) dA = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 f(x,y) dy dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      Since the problems happen at the edge of the <m>x</m> interval,
      the resulting improper integral uses a limit for the <m>x</m>
      part of the iterated integral.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_I f(x,y) dA = \lim_{a \rightarrow 0^+} \int_a^1 \int_0^1
      f(x,y) dy dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      If, instead, the function diverged to infinity as <m>y
      \rightarrow 0</m>, then the limit would be in the <m>y</m> part
      of the iterated integral. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_I f(x,y) dA = \int_0^1 \left[ \lim_{a \rightarrow 0^+}
      \int_a^1 f(x,y) dy \right] dx 
    </me>
    <p>
      Improper integrals also allow us to consider infinite domains of
      integral. For example, if I want to integrate over all of
      <m>\RR^2</m>, I set it us as follows.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{\RR^2} f(x,y) dA = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty} \lim_{b
      \rightarrow \infty} \int_{[-a,a]\times[-b,b]} f(x,y) dA
    </me>
    <p>
      Then I can write this as in iterated integral where both pieces
      are improper integrals. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{\RR^2} f(x,y) dA = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty}
      \int_{-a}^a \left[ \lim_{b \rightarrow \infty} \int_{-b}^b
      f(x,y) dy \right] dx 
    </me>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>f(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(x^2 +
          y^2)^3}}</m> on the interval <m>I = (0,1] \times (0,1]</m>.
          As I approach <m>(0,0)</m>, on the corner of the interval,
          the function is diverges to infinity. I set this up as an
          interated integral and, when necessary, I use a limit for
          the single-variable improper integral.

          This integral diverges; the volume under the curve grows to
          infinity as the domain includes more and more of the interval
          approaching the point <m>(0,0)</m>. Improper integrals, of
          course, can diverge.

      I didn't explicitly do an example of this type, but it is useful
      to mention that a particular class of integrable functions have
      a very nice integration property.

          If an integrable function on <m>I = [a,b] \times
          [c,d]</m> has the form <m>f(x,y) = g(x) h(y)</m> for
          some single variable functions <m>g</m> and <m>h</m>, then
          it is called <term>separable</term>. (This use of the term
          <sq>separable</sq> matches with the use of the term for
          separable differential equations; a differential equation

          \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)

          separable function in the sens od this definition.)

      Separable functions have nice behaviour for interated integrals.
      If <m>f(x,y) = g(x)h(y)</m> is a separable function, then its
      integral separates entirely into two single variable integrals.

      The operations in this calculation are justified because the
      pieces which I move in and out of a integral do not involve
      that variable of integration. In this way, I can separate the
      integral into two single variable integrals.
