    <title>Vectors Fields and Curves</title>
    <p>
      Let's start, again, with a vector field <m>F</m> on a set <m>U
      \subset \RR^3</m>, represented fluid flow or force. Now I'm
      going to consider a parametric curve <m>\gamma(y)</m> moving
      through the region <m>U</m>. I'm going to think of this as the
      path of an object moving through the situation caused by the
      field. If this field is, say, wind, this is an object moving
      through wind: perhaps with the wind, perhaps against it, perhaps
      across it. If the field is force, then the path is an object
      moving through the force; again, possibly along with the force
      and possibly against the force. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that this path doesn't need to be an integral curves, as
      discussed at the end of the last section. These can be paths
      influenced by the field or the can be paths of an object acting
      against the force. This could be the path of a leave in the wind
      (which, starting at rest, should be an integral curve). Or it
      could be the path of a person struggling to move upwind, acting
      against the force. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In either case, there is an interaction of the field and the
      path. In the case of the leaf in the wind, the fields and the
      path work together. In the case of the person moving upwind, the
      field and the path are opposed. I'd like to measure this
      interaction. An integral curve was defined to be a curve where
      the tangent vector and the vector field coincided. For another
      curve, the tangetn vector and the vector field may not coincide,
      but they exist and I can look at their interaction. I have a
      tool for this: the dot product. The dot product measures the
      similarity of two vector, being largest when they are in the
      same direction, negative when the are in oppositve directions,
      and zero when they are perpendicular. Given an field <m>F</m>
      and a curve <m>\gamma</m>, the dot product <m>F \cdot
      \gamma^\prime</m> will measure the interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interaction <m>F \cdot \gamma^\prime</m> tells us how the
      field and the direction of the curve interact at a point.
      However, I may want a more holistic understanding of what
      happens along the whole curve. In the process of moving along
      the curve, how does the field act? Does the field push the
      object along the curve (a positive influence) or does movement
      along the curve have to work hard to counteract the field? Or,
      perhaps, does the curve move perpendicularly to the field and
      there is no influence at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      To answer this question, I define the integral of the field
      along the parametric curve. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F</m> be a vector field and <m>\gamma(s): [0,L]</m>
          be a parametric curve parametrized by arclength. The
          <term>line integral</term> of a vector field <m>F</m> along
          a path <m>\gamma(s): [0,L] \rightarrow \RR^n</m> is the
          integral of the scalar <m>F(\gamma(s)) \cdot T(s)</m> along
          the length of the curve.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_{\gamma} F \cdot T ds = \int_{\gamma} F \cdot ds
          \defeq \int_0^L F(\gamma(s)) \cdot T(s) ds
        </me>
        <p>
          Both these notations, integrating <m>F \cdot T</m> where
          <m>T</m> is the unit tanget of the curve, and integrating
          <m>F \cdot ds</m> are conventional notations for line
          integrals. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The term <em>line integral</em> is a bit annoying, since the
      curve does not need to actually be a striaght line. The name
      comes from historical usage, where <sq>line</sq> and
      <sq>curve</sq> could be used interchangable for things like
      parametric curves. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The line integral is a measure of work or resitance of the field
      along the path. If the integral is positive then, on average,
      the field is working along with the curve. If the integral is
      negative then, on average, the curve is moving against the
      field. The integral curves of the field are the curves where the
      tangents of the curve and the field coincide: these are the
      curves that have the largest positive line integrals. As before,
      I should repeat a caution about the interpretation. Sometimes,
      curve are thought of as the paths objects take due to the action
      of the field (such as the integral curve, for objects starting
      at rest). However, sometimes curves are representing objects
      under some other volition, which may act with or against the
      fields; the line integral then measures the interaction.

    <p>
      Using the arclength parameter for the definition is appropriate
      for a strong definition. It is a unique parametrizion and gives
      the line integral a single, clear definition. However, the
      arclength parmaeter is inconvenient
      for calculation. Instead, in this section, I'll explain how to
      calculate line integrals for any parametrization. (Since I am
      starting from the arclength parameterization and going to any
      other parametrization, it will be automatically established that
      the calculation of the line integral will be independent of
      parametrization.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>\gamma(t): [a,b] \rightarrow \RR^3</m> be an arbitrary
      parametrization of a parametric curve. Then I can think of
      <m>s(t)</m> (the arclenth of the curve in terms of <m>t</m>) as
      a substitution for single variable integration. This
      substitution has <m>ds = |\gamma^\prime(t)| dt</m> and <m>T(t) =
      \gamma^\prime(t) / |\gamma^\prime(t)|</m>. I can apply this
      substitution to the definition of the line integral.

          If the distances <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are large, but

          change <m>a-b</m> is much more significant than the change
          in the term <m>ab</m> in the denominator. If I set <m>g =
          \frac{GM}{\sqrt{3}ab}</m> and pretend this is locally
          constant (which is reasonable given the assumptions about

          Now cecall that the field is defined as force per unit

          <m>h</m>, indicating the <sq>height</sq> gained in movement
          along this curve. The result then is <m>-mgh</m>, which is
          almost the high-school physics result of <m>-mgh</m>, the
          increase in potential energy, where <m>h</m> is the change
          in height and <m>g</m> the local acceleration due to gravity.

        <p>
          The only remaining difference is the negative sign. This
          relates to my previous discussion about directions of
          gradients. The force of gravity is the <em>negative</em>
          gradient of the potential energy, which introduces a sign
          adjustment to all the interpretations for potential energy.
          Mutliplying by <m>(-1)</m> to adjust for this sign
          discrepancy gives the desired result: the line integral
          represent the change in potential energey as the object
          moves along the curve. This example is archetypical for
          conservative force and will be expanded upon in the next
          section.

    <title>Fundamental Theorems</title>
    <p>
      In the previous section, I showed how to calculate line integral
      buy doing a single-variable integral where the variable of
      integration was the curve parameter. The new kind of integral, a
      line integral, was reduced to a single-variable integral which
      we already understand from single-variable calculus. This
      mirrors the approach from earlier sections in this course. For
      integration over two, three and higher dimensional region, the
      method of calculation was iterated integras, which reduce the
      problem to a series of understood single-variable integrals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reduction to single variable integrals is an excellent strategy.
      It means that I don't have to invent entirely new techniques and
      methods for multiple integrals; I can, instead, rely on all the
      previous knowledge I already have for integral. It is also very
      typical for mathematics: many, many mathematical problems are
      <sq>solved</sq> by simply reducing them to another type of
      problem that is already considered solved. However, as good as
      these reduction methods are, they miss something important. To
      understand what they are missing, let me return to the
      Fundamental Theorm of Calculus. To remind you of one of the
      formulations of the fundamental theorem, let <m>f(x)</m> be a
      differentiable function.

      The fundamental theorem say that integrating a derivative 
      Is the same as evaluating the original function on the boundary
      (endpoints) of the interval. My question now is: are there
      versions of this theorem for our new kinds of integrals? To
      understand the question, let me talk about the main pieces of
      the fundamental theorem. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to make an archetype out of the fundamental theorem. To
      that end, I'm going to boil down the idea to this basic: the
      fundamental theorem relates integrals where there is a
      derivative on the right and a boundary on the left. In this
      context, I can ask for other similar results: what theorem
      relate integrals where there is some kind of differential
      operator on the left and some kind of set boundary on the right?
      In symbols, if <m>Df</m> is some differential opreator and
      <m>\del S</m> is the boundary of some set, I am looking for
      theorems that fit this archetype:
    </p>
    <me>
       \int_S Df = \int_{\del S} f
    </me>
    <p>
      It turns out there are many such theorems. A major part of the
      rest of this course will be understanding these theorems. What
      kind of differential operators can show up on the left side, and
      for what kinds of integrals? What kinds of set and boundary
      match with the differential operators on the right? I can start
      answering this question with line integrals.

      The fundamental theorem for line integral applies to
      conservative vector fields: it says that the integral of a

      energy, then <m>f(\gamma(b)) - f(\gamma(a))</m> is the potential
      energy at the end less the potential energy at the start. This
      difference is the change in potential energy. The work to move
      through the force field is equal to the change in potential
      energy. The work can be defined in terms of kinetic energy lost
      or gained, so this says that the kinetic energy lost or gained
      is equal to the change in potential energy. Therefore, energy is
      conserved! This explains the term <sq>conservative vector
      field</sq>: these are vector fields where conservation of energy
      makes sense. (As before, there are sign issues for both gravity
      and electromagnetic force, since the gradient point in
      directions of increasing potential energy, but the model of
      physics is based on the principle of decreasing potential
      energy). 
    </p>
    <p>
      I said that the change in potential energy (the result of the
      line integral using the fundamental theorem) should be the
      negative of the change in kinetic energy. I can actually be very
      explicit with this calculation. 
      Let <m>F = \nabla f</m> be a conservative
      force. Then <m>F = ma</m>, where <m>a</m> is acceration. Also,
      if <m>\gamma</m> is a curve representing movement, then
      <m>\gamma^{\prime \prime}</m> is the acceleration. Then look
      carefully at the change in energy using the fundamental theorem
      of line integrals. I will replace the force <m>F</m> with <m>ma
      = m \gamma^{\prime \prime}</m>. (The reult of the line integral
      is the negative change in potential energy due to the
      already-frequently-mention sign reversal in these physics
      application.)

      This dot product can be written as a derivative of a different
      dot product (using the product rule). After doing so, I use
      the vector identity that a dot product of a vector with itself
      is its length squared.

      The magnitude of <m>\gamma^\prime</m> is just the scalar
      speed. Evaluated at the ends points gives the starting speed
      and the ending speed. I'll write these as <m>v_a</m> and
      <m>v_b</m>, respectively,

    <me>
      = \frac{mv_b^2}{2} - \frac{mv_a^2}{2} = \Delta KE
    </me>
    <p>
      The expression <m>\frac{1}{2} m v^2</m> is the definition of
      kinetic energy. Therefore, the result of this calculation is
      simply the ending kinetic energy minus the starting kinetic
      energy: this is the change in kinetic energy. Therefore, the
      calculation shows that the change in potential energey is the
      negative of the change in potential energy.

    <title>Properties of Conversative Vector Fields</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="section-conservative" /> I showed that conservative
      vector fiels are irrotational and, 
      conversely, an irrotation field <em>defined on
      a simply connected set</em> was guaranteed to be conservative.
      I now have a new characterization of conversative fields: their
      line integrals are path independent. Again, I can ask if
      the converse holds and again, there is a topological condition.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F</m> be a vector field on an open path-connected set
          in <m>\RR^n</m>. If the line integral
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_\gamma F \cdot ds = 0 
        </me>
        <p>
          for all closed parametric curve <m>\gamma(t)</m>, then
          <m>F</m> is a conservative field.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      Putting together the various statements on conservative vector
      fields, I can summarize their definiting properties in the
      following proposition.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F</m> be a vector field on <m>U</m> an open
          simply-connected set in <m>\RR^n</m> and let <m>\gamma:
          [a,b] \rightarrow U</m> be a parametric curve. The
          following four conditions are equivalent.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>F</m> is conservative on <m>U</m>. (By definition,
              this means <m>F = \nabla f</m> for a scalar field
              <m>f</m>).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The line integrals of <m>F</m> are path independent in
              <m>U</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The line integral of <m>F</m> is zero for any closed
              path in <m>U</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\nabla \times F = 0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
