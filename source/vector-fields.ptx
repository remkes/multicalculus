    <p>
      So far in this course and Calculus III, the multivariable
      functions I've introduced were scalar fields <m>f: \RR^n
      \rightarrow \RR</m> and parametric curves <m>\gamma: [a,b]
      \rightarrow \RR^n</m>. Parametric curves have a single variable of
      input and scalar fields have a single variable of output. Now I am
      finally going to give a complete treatment of function which have
      multiple variables for input and for output. 
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, there are two examples of the functions with multiple
      inputs and output that have already been consider: linear
      transformation in linear algebra and change of coordiantes
      functions. Both these examples treated function <m>\RR^m
      \rightarrow \RR^m</m> as transformations of space. The analysis of
      linear transformation in linear algebra implicit used this
      interpretation throughout: what does the linear algebra do to
      <m>\RR^n</m>?. The determinant calculate the change on size and
      orientation. Invertibility wondered if the changes could be
      undone. The classification of types was all about rotations,
      projects and the like <emdash /> things that happen to the ambient
      space. Change of variables functions were also about changing
      space by changing the coordinate descriptions. The Jacobians even
      used the same determinant idea to talk about the change in (local,
      infinitesimal) size under a change in variables. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Interpreting functions <m>F: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m> as
      transformations of space is very useful and valuable. It connects
      well with linear algebra, where matrices are thought of as
      transformations. It serves multiple integration by allowing
      coordinate transformations. However, it is not the only
      conceptual way to understand such functions. I am now going to
      introduce a new interpretation of these functions, and along with
      the new interpretation, a new name for these functions. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function on a region of <m>S \subset \RR^n</m> which outputs
          vectors is a <term>vector field</term>. If the output are
          vectors with <m>m</m> components, I can write the function as
          <m>F: S \rightarrow \RR^m</m>. By notational convention, I'll
          use captial letters for vector fields and lower case letter
          for scalar fields. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If <m>F: S \rightarrow \RR^m</m> is a vector field, then
          I can write <m>F = (F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_m)</m> in terms of
          its <term>components</term>. Each component <m>F_i</m> is
          itself a scalar field, has partial derivatives and gradients,
          and is subject to all the tools already defined for scalar
          fields. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The use of the word <sq>field</sq> matched the scalar fields of
      Calculus III. A scalar field assigned a scalar to every point in a
      region <m>S \subset \RR^m</m>. In familiar <m>\RR^3</m>, scalar
      fields could assign temperature, pressure, density, concentration
      and similar scalars to point. Now, a vector field assigns a vector
      to each point in a reagion <m>S \subset \RR^n</m>. This is the new
      interpretation. The ambient space is unchange, but each point in
      the ambient space is assigned a vector which has some meaning. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What does it mean to assign a vector to each point of space? The
      vector could represent a force (say a gravitational or
      electromagnetic force) that
      applies at any point in space. If could represented the local
      movement or acceleration of a fluid (wind speed/direction and
      ocean current speed/direction are a vector fields). It could
      represent the rate and direction of heat flow or diffusion of
      concentration. It could be the gradient of any scalar field
      (temperature gradient, pressure gradient, concentration gradient,
      etc.) The key thing, in all of these, is that the measurement
      assigns a vector fo each point: something with a direction and a
      magnitude. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The vector of a vector field is always a local direction vector.
      It is a vector as if the point in question is the origin, pointing
      out in some direction with some magniture from the current point
      in space.

    <title>Examples</title>
    <p>
      To visualize vector fields, I can draw arrows on a region in
      <m>\RR^2</m>. I'll do this with two examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
      <figure xml:id="figure-vector-field1">
        <caption>The Vector Field <m>F(x,y) = (0,1)</m></caption>
        <image xml:id="figure63" width="80%">
          <asymptote>
            import graph;
            size(8cm);
            path vector(pair z) {return
            (0,0)--(0,1);}
            add(vectorfield(vector,(-4,-4),(4,4)));
          </asymptote>
        </image>
      </figure>
        <p>
          Consider the constant vector field <m>F(x,y) = (0,1)</m> on
          <m>\RR^3</m>, as seen in <xref ref="figure-vector-field1" />.
          The vector <m>(0,1)</m> is a unit vector in the vertical
          y-axis direction in <m>\RR^2</m>. This vector fields
          associates that unit vertical vector to each point in
          <m>\RR^2</m> (as a local direction). At each point, the vector
          points vertically upward from that point. If this field
          represented a fluid flow, the fluid would be flowing upwards
          (in <m>y</m>) at a uniform pace everywhere, following these
          local direction vectors.
        </p>
      </statement>

              import graph;

              path vector(pair z) {return
              (0,0)--(-z.x/(1+(z.x)^2+(z.y)^2), -z.y/(1+(z.x)^2+(z.y)^2));}
              add(vectorfield(vector,(-4,-4),(4,4)));

          </image>
        </figure>
        <p>
          An excellent example of a vectors field is the force of
          gravity, shown in <xref ref="figure-vector-field2" />. The
          magnitude of the force of gravity per unit mass due to a mass
          <m>M</m> at the origin is a scalar field. <m>(x,y,z)</m> is:
        </p>
        <me>
          f = \frac{MG}{x^2+y^2+z^2}
        </me>
        <p>
          However, the force itself also includes direction, so it is a
          vector field.
        </p>
        <me>
          F = \frac{MG}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} (-x,-y,-z)
        </me>
        <p>
          The direction <m>(-x,-y,-z)</m> is back towards the origin.
          I can recover the magnitude by taking the length of the
          vector.
        </p>
        <me>
           |F| = \frac{MG}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^\frac{3}{2}} \sqrt{x^2
           +y^2+z^2} = \frac{MG}{x^2 +y^2+z^2} = \frac{MG}{r^2}
        </me>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Through the discussion of vector fields, which last for most of
      the remainder of the course, I will rely heavily on two
      applications: fields of force and fields describing fluid flow.
      These two applications are fundamental to the theory. Between
      them, they can help ground the difficult abstration of the
      discipline. For fields of force, gravity is often the first
      example <emdash /> indeed, I used it above. However,
      electromagnetic force will end up being the more important
      example. Historically, the development of the theory of vector
      fields was driven by 19th century attempts to understand
      electricity and magnestism. Many of the basics of gravitational
      action can be understood with scalar calculus, as Newton did in
      his physics. However, eletricity and magnetism are difficult to
      even start describing without vector fields.

    <title>Basic Operations on Vector Fields</title>
    <p>
      Vector fields produce vectors, one for each point in the domain.
      Since the output of the field is a vector, all the operations of
      vectors apply. Let me review these operations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Assume that <m>F</m> and <m>G</m> are two vector fields on some
      region <m>S \subset \RR^n</m>. Assume that <m>f</m> is a scalar
      field on the same region. All these operations are the ordinary
      vector operations done individually at every point in the domain
      <m>S</m>. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The length of a vector field, which is the length of each
          output vector, is a scalar field. 
        </p>
        <me>
          |F|
        </me>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If a vector field never has length zero, then I can define
          the field of unit direction of the vector field. This new
          field gives the direction of movement at each point in the
          vector field, but erases the maagnitude. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \frac{F}{|F|}
        </me>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The sum or different of two vectors fields is another vector
          field.
        </p>
        <me>
          F \pm  G 
        </me>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The dot product of two vector fields is a scalar field. 
        </p>
        <me>
          F \cdot G 
        </me>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The scalar product of a scalar field with a vector field is
          another vector field.
