    <title>19th Century Electromagnetic Observations</title>
    <p>
      In this section, I'm presenting a brief version of background to
      vector calculus. All the major tools defined in this course
      (vector fields, curl, gradient, line integrals, flux integrals,
      Gauss-Green-Stokes) are 19th century mathematics. They were
      invented very specifically to describe electricity and
      magnetism. Without getting to deep into the physics, I want to
      show you how the physical property of electricity and magnetism
      required these tools <emdash/> how these tools are precisely
      what was needed for these problems. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to start with a summary of the experimental results that
      inspired this mathematics. This list below comes from people
      experimenting in laboratories and workships. Once it was
      understood how electricity could be generated and stored, people
      were playing around with various machines to see how electricity
      behaved.  Magnets, of course, have been used since antinquity,
      but new methods of understanding how magnets worked were being
      developed at the same time. I'll start with observations of
      electricty and magnetism as two separate things. 
      (Note that all the sign conventions are arbitrary.
      What observers decided was <sq>positivie</sq> or
      <sq>negative</sq> is just a choice of conventions. The opposite
      choice could have been made and also would have produced
      consistent mathematical models.) 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Electric charge exists. There is such a thing as a
          electrically charged particle. Moreover, charge comes in two
          types: positive and negative. Charges of the same type
          repel each other and charges of opposite type attract each
          other.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Electric charges create electric fields. An electric field
          is a field of force in the volume surrounding a charged
          object. It acts on other charged object, creating an
          attractive force on objects of opposite charge and a
          repulsive force on object of the same chare. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Electric charge can move though a medium (usually metalic).
          Such a movement is called current. Typically, current
          refers to the flow of negative charges. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Unlike electric charge, isolated magnetic charge is
          impossible. There is no such thing as an isolated positive
          or negative magnetic charge (which likewise implies that
          there is no such things as magnetic current). Instead,
          magnetic charge only appears in dipoles: objects that have a
          positive pole and a negative pole. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Magnetic dipoles create a magnetic field. A magnetic field
          is a field of force in the volume surrounding a magnetic
          dipoles which acts on other magnetic dipoles. The field
          pulls the negative end of other dipoles towards the
          positive end of the original dipole, and likewise for the
          pulling the positive end of other dipoles towards the
          negative ned of the original dipole. 
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      That summarizes the observations about electricity and magnetism
      by themselves. But perhaps the most important observation was
      the fact that electricity and magnetism interact. Moreover, the
      interact in some very strange and unexpected ways. Here is a
      list of various interactions that were observed. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A current (moving electric charge) through a wire creates
          a magnetic field. The direct of this field is circular,
          moving around the wire. The direction of the current and the
          direction of the rotation agree by a right-hand-rule. (The
          right-hand-rule is a result of the various sign conventions;
          different choices of positive and negative charge, or
          positive and negative ends of a magnet, would have lead
          instead to a left-hand-rule.) 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          As an application of the previous point, if the wire is
          wrapped into a solenoid (a ring formed of coiled wire,
          essentially), it creates a magnetic field inside the
          solenoid. The direction of this magnetic field is point
          through the ring (again, following a right-hand-rule) for the
          direction of the field and the direction of rotation of the
          current in the ring. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A changing magnetic field (produced, say, by spinning a
          magnetc and thus moving the resulting magnetic field)
          produces an electric field and thus an electric force on
          nearby electrically charged particles. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Magnetic fields act only on moving charged particles and
          induce torque to change the direction of movement.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The key piece in all these interactions is change or movement. A
      static electric field doesn't do anything to a stationy magnets.
      Likewise, a stationary magnets doesn't have an effect on a
      stational electrically charge particular. It's only when
      something is changing (the magnetic field is changing, the
      charge is moving in a curren, etc) that the interaction happens.
      The interactions are all dynamic.

      Now I'm going to try to take the observations from the previous
      list and describe them in a mathematical model. I'm going to use
      all the tools of this course, but remember, when this was first
      done, the mathematics tools had to be <em>invented</em>. First,
      let me describe the model for static situation. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Isolated electric charges exit. If there is a charge at a
          point, I can just attach a value <m>q</m> to that point.
          <m>q</m> is the conventional letter for charge and has units
          of coulombs. In the SI system, coulombs are a derived unit,
          since it was decided that current should be the fundamental
          unit. A coulomb is the same as an amp-second, written
          <m>A\cdot s</m>. In addition to point charges, often there
          is a distribution of charge in a region. This can be described
          as a charge density, which is a scalar field
          <m>\rho(x,y,z)</m>. Charge density has units of coulombs per
          cubic metre, <m>\frac{C}{m^3}</m> or amp-seconds per cubic metre,
          <m>\frac{A \cdot s}{m^3}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Electric charge (either a point charge or a distribution of
          charge in a region) creates a field  <m>E(x,y,z)</m> of
          force per unit charge. The field acts on other potential
          charges in the region around the existing charge. 
          The field <m>E</m> has unit of volts per meter. Again, in
          the SI system, the volt is a derived unit and the base units
          for electric fields are <m>\frac{kg \cdot m}{s^3 \cdot A}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In addition to charge, the flow of charge in current exists.
          This is usually described by a current density <m>J</m>
          which describe current flowing through a cross-sectional
          area. <m>J</m> has units of coulombs per
          second-square-metre. In SI units, <m>J</m> has units of
          <m>\frac{A}{m^2}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          There is a universal constant which determine the strength
          of interaction due to electric fields. This constant is
          called the permittivity of the vacuum and has the value 
          <m>\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12}</m> with units
          <m>\frac{s^4 \cdot A^2}{m^3 \cdot kg}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If a charge density <m>\rho</m> is creating the electric
          field <m>E</m>, the relationship between the charge
          density and the field is given by the divergence
          differential operator: <m>\nabla \cdot E =
          \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Isoated magnetic charge does not exist, so not symbols or
          units are assigned to it. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A magnetic dipole creates a force <m>B</m>. Following the
          observations, this force acts on a <em>moving</em>
          electrically charged particle by changing its direction of
          movement. Therefore, it is natural to describe this field
          as thee force per charge-velocity The unit of <m>B</m>
          the telsa, which in SI base units is <m>\frac{kg}{A\cdot
          s^2}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          There is a universial constant that describe the strengh
          of magnetic field interactions. This constant is called
          permeability of the vacuum and has value 
          <m>\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}</m> with units <m>\frac{m 
          \cdot kg}{s^2 \cdot A^2}</m>. (This universal constant is not
          independent of other constants; it is, in fact, a derived
          value. This explains why it has a value involving
          <m>4\pi</m> instead of just an arbitrary decimal.) 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Since there are no monopoles, all magnetic charged is
          balanced. This is reflected in the mathematical by the
          equation <m>\nabla \times B = 0</m>. 
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now I can move on to the dynamic interactions between
      electricity and magnetism. I'll start with the effect of statis
      fields on a charged particle. Both static situations (electric and
      magnetic) produce fields and forces on charged particles. The
      action on charged particles by both <m>E</m> and <m>B</m> is
      summarized in an equation called the Lorentz force law. If
      <m>q</m> is a charged particle travelling with velocity
      <m>v</m>, then the force caused by electric and magnetic fields
      on the charged particular satisfies this equation.
    </p>
    <me>
      F = Eq + q (v \times B)
    </me>
    <p>
      Now I need the model to consider changinge electric and magnetic
      fields. A key part of the observation what that changes in
      electrical fields produce magnetic fields and vice-versa. How is
      this described, mathematically? 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A changing <m>E</m> fields induces a <m>B</m> field and
          vice-versa.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In addition, a current induces a <m>B</m> field.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Magnetic current is impossible, so it cannot induce a
          <m>E</m> field.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The induced <m>E</m> field due to a changing 
          <m>B</m> field satisfies a differential equation.
        </p>
        <me>
          \nabla \times E = \frac{-\del B}{\del t}
        </me>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The induced <m>B</m> field due to a changing electric field
          <m>E</m> and a current density <m>J</m>
          also satisfies a differential equation.
        </p>
        <me>
          \nabla \times B = \mu_0 J + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{\del
          E}{\del t}
        </me>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this mathematical object, I have written down four
      differential equations. This is the first presentation of
      Maxwell's equations. (This version is the presentation via
      differential operators; a second presentation will follow
      below). There are four equations: two for statics, which
      calculate divergence of the fields, and two for dynmanics, which
      calculate curl of the fields. Without fields, curl and
      divergence, such differential equations are impossible to state;
      therefore, the concepts of vector fields, curl and divergence
      were invented in order to be able to state the fundamental
      equations that govern electricity and magnetism. To determine
      the time behaviour of an electromagnetic system means solving
      these four differential equations for whatever initial
      conditions describe the system. (This is, in general, a very
      difficult problem).

    <title>Gauss-Green-Stokes and Maxwell's Equations</title>
    <p>
      Some of the 19th century electro-magnetic observations directly
      measured charge, field and current, leading to the equations in
      the previous section. However, often the fields are difficult
      to measure directly; instead, their flux through various
      surfaces can be measured in the laboratory. Flux essentially
      measure the fields strength via particular apparatus in a
      laboratory. To that end, there is a second presentation of 
      Maxwell's equations using the flux of fields, not just the
      fields themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the relationship between the two presentations? How do I
      go from the equations above, with curls and divergences, to
      equations of flux? I apply Gauss' and Stokes' theorem to the
      first presentation of Maxwell's equations. This is why Gauss'
      and Stokes' theorems were discovered and what made them so
      fundamental to the discipline.  They transform the equation of
      fields into equations of flux which can be measure more
      reasonable in laboratory situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>D</m> be a solid region of space and <m>\sigma</m> a
      parametric surface (not necessarily the boundary of <m>D</m>).
      Before stating the new version of Maxwell's equations, I need
      some new notations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>Q_D</m> is the total charge in the solid region
          <m>D</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>I_\sigma</m> is the total current flowing through a
          surface.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\Phi_{E,\sigma}</m> is the flux of <m>E</m> through
          <m>\sigma</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\Phi_{B,\sigma}</m> is the flux of <m>B</m> through
          <m>\sigma</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now, if <m>\sigma</m> is the bounding surface for the region
      <m>D</m>, then I can apply Gauss' theorem to the field
      <m>E</m>.
    </p>
    <me>
      \Phi_{E,\sigma} = \int_\sigma E \cdot dA = \int_D \nabla \cdot
      E dV = \int_D \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} dV =
      \frac{Q_D}{\epsilon_0}
    </me>
    <p>
      I can do the same for <m>B</m>, remembering that <m>\nabla
      \cdot B = 0</m>.
    </p>
    <me>
      \Phi_{B,\sigma} = \int_\sigma B \cdot dA = \int_D \nabla \cdot
      B dV = \int_D 0 dV = 0
    </me>
    <p>
      Now let <m>\sigma</m> be any surface (not the boundary of
      <m>D</m>) and let <m>\gamma</m> be its boundary. I can think
      of <m>\gamma</m> as a loop of wire, and <m>\sigma</m> the
      surface inside the loop. The line integral of <m>E</m> along
      the wire is the work done on by the field moving electrons along
      the wire. I can use Stokes' theorem and the firsr presentation
      of Maxwell's equation to calculate the line integral.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_\gamma E \cdot ds = \int_{\sigma} (\nabla \times E) \cdot
      dA = - \int_\sigma \frac{\del B}{\del t} \cdot dA  =
      -\frac{\del}{\del
      t} \Phi_{B,\sigma}
    </me>
    <p>
      Thinking the other way around, this calculates the flux through
      the wire of the magnetic field induced by the current. If the
      loop is now a series of loops in a solenoid, the flux adds up,
      so more loops gives move surface area, hence more flux, hence a
      greater induced magnetic field. A transformer is formed from two
      solenoids, where a current in one solenoid induced a magnetic
      fields which, in turn, induces a new current in the other
      solenoid. In such a transformer, the designer can adjusting the
      ingoing and outgoing current by having different numbers of
      coils on each solenoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      For magnetic fields, I can do the same Stokes' theorem
      calculation.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_\gamma B \cdot ds = \int_{\sigma} (\nabla \times B) \cdot
      dA = \int_\sigma \mu_0 J \cdot dA + \int_\sigma \mu_0
      \epsilon_0 \frac{\del E}{\del t} = \mu_0 I_\sigma + \mu_0
      \epsilon_0 \frac{\del}{\del t} \Phi_{E, \sigma}
    </me>
    <p>
      Now I can put all these equation together into the second
      presentation of Maxwell's equations. In the first two equations,
      <m>\sigma</m> is the closed boundary of <m>D</m>. In the second
      two equations, <m>\sigma</m> is an open surface with boundary
      <m>\gamma</m>.

    <title>Maxwell's Equations in a Vacuum</title>
    <p>
      As I said above, actually solving Maxwell's equations is very
      difficult. This is particularly true since all of the physical
      condition of the situation are build into the initial conditions
      of the differential equations, which can be very complicated.
      However, I could choose the easiest initial condition possible:
      none at all. 
    <p>
    </p>
      This train of through leads to a very strange question: what
      happens if I consider Maxwell's
      equation in a vacuum with no external influence? There is
      nothing there, no charge, no current, no wires. However, the
      existence of electrical and magnetic fields in a vacuum is
      possible, so the differential equations still might have
      something to say. I'll work with the first presentation of
      Maxwell's equations here. I'll see all the charge and current
      terms to zero, since there are no charge particles, no currents,
      and no magnets in a vacuum. Here are the resulting differential
      equations.

      This is a difficult system of differential equations, but it
      does have a solution. Therefore, at least mathematically, there
      can be electic and magnetic field existing in a vacuum, even
      without any charge, current, or magnetic dipoles. The method for
      solving this differential equation is strange; I'm going to
      perform some random operations, but they do eventually lead
      towards a solution. The general stragtegy is to work with the
      third and fourth equations and try to decouple them, producing
      equations for <m>E</m> and <m>B</m> separately. In the process,
      the first two equations will be use to remove any divergence
      terms that arise while working with the other equations.

      The first operation is to take the last of
      Maxwell's equation an apply the curl operator to both sides of
      the equation. On the right side, there is a curl and a time
      derivative. With reasonably assumption about <m>B</m>, I can
      interchange the order of these derivatives and then use
      Maxwell's third equation to replace <m>B</m>.

      I've manage to get away from equations that involves <m>E</m>
      and <m>B</m> and produce a differential equation that only
      involves the electric field. This is progress. Now I want to
      adjust this equation into something I can actually solve.  There
      is an identity for doing the curl twice:  <m>\nabla \times
      (\nabla \times F) = \nabla (\nabla \cdot F) - \nabla^2 F</m>,
      where the Laplacian here means the Laplacian of each of the
      three components of <m>E</m>. (Feel free to verify this identity
      if you wish).  IN this case, the first term is <m>0</m>, since
      <m>\nabla \cdot E =0</m>, so the remaining term is <m>\nabla
      \times( \nabla \times E) = -\nabla^2 E</m>. I'll replace the
      left side of the previous equation with this expression.

      A similar process exists starting with the third equation,
      applying the curl to both sides, replacing the <m>E</m> field
      with the fourth equation and simplifying the differential
      operators. It produces a very similar equation for <m>B</m>

      These are wave equations, so I expect that we will have wave
      solutions for <m>E</m> and <m>B</m>. The full solutions are
      very general, so I'm going to make some more assumptions which
      are justified by observation. First, I'll assume <m>E \perp
      B</m>. Second, I'll assume that <m>z</m> is the direction of
      propogation of the waves and the waves displacements are only in
      the <m>xy</m> plane.  By readjusting coordinates under these
      assumption, I can write <m>E = (E_1(z,t),0,0)</m> and <m>B = (0,
      B_2(z,t),0)</m>. Then we have two differential equations in the
      scalar fields <m>E_1</m> and <m>B_2</m>.

      What have I done here? I've shown that starting in a vacuum and
      making some geometric assumptions about the solutions, these
      trig function waves are valid electric and magnetic fields that
      can exist in a vacuum. These waves propogate in the <m>z</m>
      direction at a certain rate. The coefficient of <m>t</m> gives
      that rate. I can calculate the rough value of this coefficient
      (which depends only on the two fundamental constants).

      \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \epsilon_0}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{8.86\times

      The units also work out to recover a velocity. I'll put in the
      SI units for the permittivity and permeability constants.

      This is a familiar number: <m>c</m>, the speed of light. And
      light is exactly what this wave is: propogation of
      electromagnetic fields through a vacuum is light. At the time
      of Maxwell, light was not understood as electromagnetic
      radiation. Maxwell argued that his system predicted the
      electromagnetic nature of light, which was eventually proved
      correct. This is one of the major accomplishment of Maxwell's
      equations: just by solving them in a vacuum, they reproduce
      descriptions of light as an electromagnetic wave.

      Lastly, this also explains by one of the three constants (as it
      was developed historically, this ended up being permeability) is
      not independent. Once you know the permittivity of space and the
      speed of light, the permeability can be calculated from those
      two constants. Again, this explains the strange <m>4\pi</m> in
      the definition of permeability: it is a derived constants, based
      on knowing the permittivity of space, the speed of light, and
      the SI unit conventions.
