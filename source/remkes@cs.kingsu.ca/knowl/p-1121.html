<div class="para">No matter how strange the path is, no matter how many times it loops around and goes elsewhere, only the endpoints matter. Let me go back to conservative fields as forces which come from a potential energy scalar field. If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is this potential energy, then <span class="process-math">\(f(\gamma(b)) - f(\gamma(a))\)</span> is the potential energy at the end less the potential energy at the start. This difference is the change in potential energy. The work to move through the force field is equal to the change in potential energy. The work can be defined in terms of kinetic energy lost or gained, so this says that the kinetic energy lost or gained is equal to the change in potential energy. Therefore, energy is conserved! This explains the term ‘conservative vector field’: these are vector fields where conservation of energy makes sense. (As before, there are sign issues for both gravity and electromagnetic force, since the gradient point in directions of increasing potential energy, but the model of physics is based on the principle of decreasing potential energy).</div>
