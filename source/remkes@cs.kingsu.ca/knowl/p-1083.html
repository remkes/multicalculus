<div class="para">The constant of integration reflects the fact that energy levels are arbitrarily set. Energy is relative to some arbitrary set base level. On the surface of the earth, you can set potential energy to be zero when something is on the ground, so that it can gain potential energey as it moves up. In planetary systems with the gravitional source at the origin, the convention is to set potential energy to <span class="process-math">\(-\infty\)</span> (in the limit) at the origin, increasing to <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as the distance from the origin goes to <span class="process-math">\(\infty\text{.}\)</span> These are convenient conventions for the calculations physicists want to do with energy, but they are just convention.</div>
