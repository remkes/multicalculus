<div class="para">This can be thought of in terms of particple/wave duality. A particle, as a probability distribution, is just a single peak. A wave, as a probability distribution, has a sinusoidal graph. Momentum is essentially wavelength in this interpretation. A particple has a definite position: the single peak is located somewhere. However, with no repetition, it has no wavelength. A wave has a wavelength, but since the graph extends outward, it has no fixed position. The uncertainly principle reflects how elementary objects have both wave and particple like behaviour, one to the exclusion of the other.</div>
