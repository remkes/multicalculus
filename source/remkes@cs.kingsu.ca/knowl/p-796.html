<div class="para">Like with polar coordinates, it is useful to know the shapes give by setting one of the three coordinates to a constant. The locus of <span class="process-math">\(r=c\)</span> is a cylinder of radius <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> around the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis. The cylinder extends infinitely in the positive and negative <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis. This cylinder is the source of the names of the system and, indeed, if it the easiest system to describe or integration over a cylinder. The locus of <span class="process-math">\(\theta
= c\)</span> is a halfplace extending out from the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis; all points which have a particular angle in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> plane. Finally, <span class="process-math">\(z=c\)</span> is a horizontal plane at a fixed height <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> This is the same as cartesian coordinates, since the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> of cylindrical and the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> of cartesian coordinates are excatly the same.</div>
