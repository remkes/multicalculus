<div class="para">Both of these observations generalize the relationship between distance and speed from single variable calculus. In that setting, the relationship was relatively direct: if <span class="process-math">\(d(t)\)</span> was distance, then <span class="process-math">\(d^\prime(t)\)</span> was speed and if <span class="process-math">\(v(t)\)</span> was speed then <span class="process-math">\(\int v(t) dt\)</span> was distance. The idea here is exactly the same, but since the movement is much more complicated, going through multi-dimensional space, I need more complicated definitions and notations to access the idea.</div>
