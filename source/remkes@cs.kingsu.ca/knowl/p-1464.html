<div class="para">This is a difficult system of differential equations, but it does have a solution. Therefore, at least mathematically, there can be electic and magnetic field existing in a vacuum, even without any charge, current, or magnetic dipoles. The method for solving this differential equation is strange; Iâ€™m going to perform some random operations, but they do eventually lead towards a solution. The general stragtegy is to work with the third and fourth equations and try to decouple them, producing equations for <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> separately. In the process, the first two equations will be use to remove any divergence terms that arise while working with the other equations.</div>
