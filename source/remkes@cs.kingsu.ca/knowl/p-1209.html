<div class="para">Given a vector field and a parametric curve, the line integral measured the interaction of the field and the curve. It told how much the field helped or hindered movement along the curve. This was measured by a dot product of the field with the tangent to the curve, since the dot product nicely measures the interaction of two vector. Now, instead of asking for the action of a field along a curve, Iâ€™m interesting in the action of a field through a surface.</div>
