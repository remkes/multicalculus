<div class="para">Here, <span class="process-math">\(\del\)</span> is a boundary operator for geoemtric object and <span class="process-math">\(df\)</span> is some kind of derivative of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> On one side, there is a derivative; on the other side, there is a boundary. So far, the boundaries of curves or intervals are just points. The right side is the ‘integral’ of a function on two points, which is simply evaluation at the point. In this section, however, I’ll be talking about surfaces. In general, the boundary of a surface will be a one dimensional object (a parametric curve, hopefully). There is no such thing as ‘evaluation’ along a parametric curve; instead, there is a line integral. Therefore, I really do expect integrals on the right side of the archetypical equation. The full understanding of the fundamental theorem is that there are integrations on both sides: integral of a derivative on the right and integration over a boundary on the left. Before I get to the major results, though, I have to talk about boundaries.</div>
