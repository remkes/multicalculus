<div class="para">Hopefully, this is enough to get an informal sense of the boundary of a parametric surface. Now I need to talk about orientation. For curves, orientation came from the notion of direction: moving from the start to the end. For parametric surfaces, there isnâ€™t a direction of movement, but there is the direction of the normal. The normal defines a notion of above and below the surface, which is how I will treat orientation. By convention, the normal will point above, and the negative of the normal will point below. (Changing the order of the variables in the parametrization of a surface will change the order of the cross product, thus the sign of the normal.)</div>
