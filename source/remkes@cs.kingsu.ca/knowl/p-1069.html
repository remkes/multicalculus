<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> be an open subset of <span class="process-math">\(\RR^n\text{.}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is called <dfn class="terminology">path connected</dfn> if there is a parametric curve connecting any two points <span class="process-math">\(a, b \in U\text{.}\)</span> (Recall in the definition in Calculus III that parametric curves are always continuous.) A parametric curve is falled <dfn class="terminology">closed</dfn> if its start and end poitns are the same. If <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is path connected, it is also called <dfn class="terminology">simply connected</dfn> if any closed path can be contracted down to a point. (Think of the path as a loop in a rope, and contraction as pulling the rope so that the loop disappears. This needs to happen in such a way that all the intermediate steps are still paths in the set <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span>).</div>
