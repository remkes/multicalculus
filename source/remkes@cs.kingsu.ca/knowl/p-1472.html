<div class="para">This is a familiar number: <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> the speed of light. And light is exactly what this wave is: propogation of electromagnetic fields through a vacuum is light. At the time of Maxwell, light was not understood as electromagnetic radiation. Maxwell argued that his system predicted the electromagnetic nature of light, which was eventually proved correct. This is one of the major accomplishment of Maxwellâ€™s equations: just by solving them in a vacuum, they reproduce descriptions of light as an electromagnetic wave.</div>
