<div class="para">I could do a general calculation to show that <span class="process-math">\(v \cdot (u
\times v) = 0\text{.}\)</span> Since a dot product of two vectors is zero if and only if the vectors are perpendicular, the vector <span class="process-math">\(v
\times u\)</span> is perpendicular to both <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> This turns out to be a very useful property of the cross product: it produces a result that is perpendicular to both original vectors. This is part of the reason that is is unique to <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\text{:}\)</span> in three dimensions, if you have two set (non-parallel) direction, there is a unique direction that is perpendicular to both. The cross product constructs that unique direction.</div>
