<div class="para">In this section, Iâ€™m presenting a brief version of background to vector calculus. All the major tools defined in this course (vector fields, curl, gradient, line integrals, flux integrals, Gauss-Green-Stokes) are 19th century mathematics. They were invented very specifically to describe electricity and magnetism. Without getting to deep into the physics, I want to show you how the physical property of electricity and magnetism required these tools  how these tools are precisely what was needed for these problems.</div>
