<div class="para">The connection is given by a right-hand-rule. The normal defines a side which is above the surface. Looking down at the surface from this above side, the boundary loop must go counter-clockwise. This is called a right-hand-rule because if the thumb of a right hand points in the directin of the normal, the fingers curl in this counter-clockwise direction. Note that this is a completely arbitrary convention: using clockwise curves and a left-hand-rule would have also given consistent mathematics, as long as the same rule is used consistently.</div>
