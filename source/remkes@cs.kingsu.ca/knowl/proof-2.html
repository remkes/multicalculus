<div class="para">There are several ways to argue this result. First, I can think about the geometry of the sphere and its tangents (though, I confess, this argument uses some ideas from future weeks in the course.) Since <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> is always a unit vector, the path of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> is a path on the unit sphere in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\text{.}\)</span>  The tangent direction of this path, therefore, must be a tangent to the unit sphere. Unit vector point directly out of the unit sphere; they are perpendicular to tangent vectors of the unit sphere. Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gamma^\prime\)</span> must be perpendicular vectors.</div> <div class="para">Alternatively, I could argue more directly from the definition of a unit vector. If <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> is a unit vector, its length can never change -- the length is fixed at one. If <span class="process-math">\(\gamma^\prime(t)\)</span> share any small direction with <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> (more formally, if the projection was non-zero), then there would be a portion of the tangent vector pointing in the direction of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t)\text{.}\)</span> This would indicate that there is change in the direction of the vector. Such a change would necessarily change the length of the vector; increasing it is the growth is aligned with the vector, and decreasing it is the growth is against the vector. Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gamma^\prime(t)\)</span> cannot share any such small direction.  The projection of the latter onto the former must be zero, which is equivalent to them being perpendicular.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-calculus-of-parametric-curves.html#proof-2" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
