<div class="para">The cross product differs from the dot product in several important ways. First, it produces a new vector in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\text{,}\)</span> not a scalar. For this reason, when working in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\text{,}\)</span> the dot product is often referred to as the <dfn class="terminology">scalar product</dfn> and the cross product as the <dfn class="terminology">vector product</dfn>. Second, the dot product measures, in some sense, the similarity of two vectors. The cross product measures, in some sense, the difference between two vectors. The cross product has a greater magnitude if the vectors are closer to being perpendicular. The dot product is zero if two vectors are perpendicular, but the cross product is zero if two vectors are parallel.</div>
