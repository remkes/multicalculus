<div class="para">However, I can also iterate partial derivatives in different variables. Consider a function of two variables <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y)\text{.}\)</span> I can pretend <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is constant and take the derivative in <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Then, having done that, I can switch and present <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is constant to take the derivative in <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> This is called a mixed partial and is written with the following notation.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\del^2 f}{\del x \del y}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">In the denominator of this notation, <span class="process-math">\(\del x \del y\text{,}\)</span> the derivative in <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> happens first and the derivative in <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> happens second. This is like the right-to-left notation for functions. This notation (hopefully) makes sense in terms of of differential operators. An operator acts on functions on the left, so the piece closest to the function (the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> derivative in this case) happens first.</div>
