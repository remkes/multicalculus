<div class="para">Change: abbreviate, just focus on intervals and open set in two and three dimensions. Enough to do iterated integrals and understand GGS statements. Topology is a branch of mathematics which studies concepts of shape, near-ness and distance. You might think that such a study woulds just be geometry, and you would be partially correct. Topology is like a coarser version of geometry. It cares about broad notions of near and far instead of precise distances, and about types of shapes instead of precisely defined specifics. Though it lacks the precision of other parts of geometry, it is fundamental to modern mathematics.</div>
