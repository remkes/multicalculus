<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(F = (y, z e^{y^2}, x + z^2 e^{z^2})\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> be the semicirlce from <span class="process-math">\((-3,0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((3,0,0)\)</span> which lies in the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> part of the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>plane. What is the line integral?</div> <div class="para">First, I can check that <span class="process-math">\(\nabla \times F = (-1,1,0)\text{,}\)</span> so the field is not conservative. I might seem that no theorem can help here. The field is not conservative, so the fundamental theorem of line integrals doesn’t apply. The curve is not closed, so Stokes’ theorem doesn’t apply.</div> <div class="para">However, I can do something clever to make sure one of the theorems applies. Consider the path <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\((3,0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((-3,0,0)\)</span> along the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis. Then <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> followed by <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> is a closed path which is the boundary of the half-circle of radius <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> plane. Call the half circle <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\text{.}\)</span> Using this as the surface, I can apply Stokes’ theorem. F</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\del \sigma} F \cdot ds = \int_\sigma (\nabla
\times F) \cdot dA

</div>
<div class="para">The line integral over <span class="process-math">\(\del \sigma\)</span> is the line integral over <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> plus the line integral over <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{.}\)</span> Writing the two line integral, I can solve for the line integral over <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\int_\gamma F \cdot ds = \int_\sigma (\nabla \times F)

</div>
<div class="para">This clever use of Stokes’ theorem has changes the original integral into two integrals. This might seem counterproductive, but these two integrals on the right are notably easier than the first integral. <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> is entirely on the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis, so <span class="process-math">\(F = (0,0,x)\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(y = z = 0\text{.}\)</span> The tangent to <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\((1,0,0)\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(F \cdot N =
0\text{,}\)</span> which means the second integral on the right vanishes.</div> <div class="para">The normal to <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\((0,0,-1)\text{,}\)</span> pointing in the negative <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> direction to match orientation. <span class="process-math">\((\nabla \times F) \cdot N = (-1,1,0) \cdot (0,0,-1) =
0\text{,}\)</span> so the first integral on the right also vanishes. Together, I can conclude that the original line integral is also zero.</div> <div class="para">Note that the field is not conservative, so a different path from <span class="process-math">\((-3,0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((3,0,0)\)</span> might have a different value. If I worked in the <span class="process-math">\(xz\)</span> plane instead of the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> plane with the same setup, the second integral would still vanish but the normal to <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> would be <span class="process-math">\((0,-1,0)\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\((\nabla \times
F) \cdot N = (-1)\)</span> and the value of the first integral would be non-zero.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\int_\sigma -1 dA = - \frac{9\pi}{2} \implies \int_\gamma
F \cdot ds = \frac{-9\pi}{2}
