<div class="para">I’ll assume that <span class="process-math">\(\Psi(x,t)\)</span> has only one variable of position. (The following derivation works in three variables of position with roughly the same steps, but the notation becomes much more challenging). The expectation value for position is <span class="process-math">\(\langle x\rangle\text{.}\)</span> What is momentum? It should be (up to a mass term) the rate of change of position. But the only available sense of position is the expectation value. Therefore, I should try to calculate <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\del \langle
x\rangle}{\del t}\text{.}\)</span> I use the compatibility of integration and differentiation to exchange the operations. (There are theorems, which I’ve omitted in this course, which allow this exchange).</div>
