<div class="para">Since these three named theorems are of similar form, they are often referred to as Gauss-Green-Stokes (or even GGS). All three of these people were 19th century mathematics/physicists and all of them were involved with the development of the physics of electricity and magnetism. In <a href="section-maxwell.html" class="internal" title="Section 12.2: Maxwell’s Equations">Section 12.2</a>, I’ll give the details of that project. This mathematics was specifically invented to describe electricity and magnetism, since no previous mathematics could describe the experimental results observed in these 19th laboratories and workshops.</div>
