<div class="para">I’ll start in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^2\)</span> with Green’s theorem. Let <span class="process-math">\(F(x,y) = (\sin x, x^2 y^3)\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> be the triangle with vertices <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((2,0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((2,2)\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> is the path in three straight lines from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((2,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((2,2)\)</span> and back to <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\text{.}\)</span> (This shows why piece-wise differentiable conditions are useful: allowing these sharp corners on the boundary path is very reasonable.) The line integral of <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> could be calculated in three steps, by parametrizing each line segments and calculating those line integrals. However, I’ve prefer not to have to figure out these three parametrization. Green’s theorem gives me an alternate way to calcaulate the line integral by integrating over the triangle.</div>
