<div class="para">I need to understand the intersection of these two surfaces. I can substitute for <span class="process-math">\(z\text{,}\)</span> since it is already isolated, which lets me solve to find <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2 = 3\text{.}\)</span> In the first equation, that also gives <span class="process-math">\(z=3\text{.}\)</span> So the intersection of the two surfaces is the circle of radius <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> in the <span class="process-math">\(z=3\)</span> plane. I want the region between the two surfaces, which must be the region between the surfaces inside the radius of this circle. Inside the circle, <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2 &gt; 2(x^2+y^2) - 3\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> ranges from <span class="process-math">\(2(x^2+y^2)-3\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2\)</span> I can describe the region  as <span class="process-math">\(x \in [-3,3]\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> between <span class="process-math">\(-\sqrt{9-x^2}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{9-x^2}\)</span> and then <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> varies betwen the two surfaces. Iâ€™ve used a computer algebra system for expansions of some of the polynomial terms.</div>
