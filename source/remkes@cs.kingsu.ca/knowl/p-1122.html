<div class="para">I said that the change in potential energy (the result of the line integral using the fundamental theorem) should be the negative of the change in kinetic energy. I can actually be very explicit with this calculation. Let <span class="process-math">\(F = \nabla f\)</span> be a conservative force. Then <span class="process-math">\(F = ma\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is acceration. Also, if <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> is a curve representing movement, then <span class="process-math">\(\gamma^{\prime \prime}\)</span> is the acceleration. Then look carefully at the change in energy using the fundamental theorem of line integrals. I will replace the force <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(ma
= m \gamma^{\prime \prime}\text{.}\)</span> (The reult of the line integral is the negative change in potential energy due to the already-frequently-mention sign reversal in these physics application.)</div>
