<div class="para">Coming to grips with the fact that the same shape can have multiple parametrizations is a major part of the conceptual challenge of parametric curves. When I calculate, I need to be conscious of the varied parametrizations. If I calculate the length of the shape, I want that length to be the same, regardless of how fast the movement is along the curve. Therefore, the length calculation should be independent of the parametrization. However, if I want to no details about the local movement (speed, acceleration, change in directions), then these calculations should depened on the parametrization. Different parametrizations will move along the curve at different rates, and therefore have different speeds, accelerations, etc. The next two sections work out all this calculus of parametric curves, and everything in those two sections will be careful with the variability of the parametrization.</div>
