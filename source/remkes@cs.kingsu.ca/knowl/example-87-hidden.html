The cone, plus the portion of the sphere above the cone, gives a shape that is something like an ice-cream cone; itâ€™s a cone plus a spherically curved cap at the top of the cone. What is the volume of this object?</div> <div class="para">If I put the centre of the sphere at <span class="process-math">\((0,0,R)\text{,}\)</span> then the vertex of the cone can be put at the origin. The equation of such a sphere is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x^2+ y^2 + (z-R)^2 = R^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(r^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2\text{,}\)</span> this equation simplifies into <span class="process-math">\(r^2 = 2 R z\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(r^2 = 2Rr\cos \phi\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(r = 2R\cos \phi\text{.}\)</span> This can be taken at the outside bound of the radius term, as <span class="process-math">\(\phi \in \left[0,
\frac{\pi}{2} \right]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\theta \in [0, 2\pi]\text{.}\)</span> The flare of the cone is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\pi}{6}\text{,}\)</span> which restricts <span class="process-math">\(\phi \in \left[0,
\frac{\pi}{6} \right]\text{.}\)</span> I integrate with these bounds for the volume, making sure that <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is an inside integral since its bounds depend on <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{.}\)</span> Since this is volume, the integrand is <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> I need to remember the Jacobian.</div>

\amp = 2\pi \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{6}} \frac{r^3}{3}

\amp = 2\pi \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{6}} \frac{8R^3 \cos^3
