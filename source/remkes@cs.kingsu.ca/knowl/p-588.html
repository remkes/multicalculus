<div class="para">As an aside, there are also different notions of integrability and different definition of the integral. What I have discussed here is the Riemann integral, and this notion of integrability is Riemann-integrability. In higher mathematics, the most commonly used definition of the integral is a different definition, called the Lebesgue integral. It is also an approximation process, but it involve approximating the function with a special functions that only take finitely many values. The Lebesgue integral agrees with the Riemann integral on all Riemann-integrable functions.  However, there are functions where the Lebesgue integral is defined but the limit in the Riemann integral fails to converge.  It is interesting to observe that something as fundamental as the integral has multiple definitions and the choice of definitions has a real, measurable effect on our mathematics. A different kind of calculus course, one more interested in the mathematical foundations, would delve into the details of these different notions of the integral and integrebility.</div>
