<div class="para">Let’s start, again, with a vector field <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> on a set <span class="process-math">\(U
\subset \RR^3\text{,}\)</span> represented fluid flow or force. Now I’m going to consider a parametric curve <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(y)\)</span> moving through the region <span class="process-math">\(U\text{.}\)</span> I’m going to think of this as the path of an object moving through the situation caused by the field. If this field is, say, wind, this is an object moving through wind: perhaps with the wind, perhaps against it, perhaps across it. If the field is force, then the path is an object moving through the force; again, possibly along with the force and possibly against the force.</div>
