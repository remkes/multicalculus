<div class="para">Reduction to single variable integrals is an excellent strategy. It means that I don’t have to invent entirely new techniques and methods for multiple integrals; I can, instead, rely on all the previous knowledge I already have for integral. It is also very typical for mathematics: many, many mathematical problems are ‘solved’ by simply reducing them to another type of problem that is already considered solved. However, as good as these reduction methods are, they miss something important. To understand what they are missing, let me return to the Fundamental Theorm of Calculus. To remind you of one of the formulations of the fundamental theorem, let <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> be a differentiable function.</div>
