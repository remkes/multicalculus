<div class="para">Now consider a lamina with <span class="process-math">\(y \in [-1,1]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> bounded between <span class="process-math">\(\pm y^4\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(\rho = 1\text{.}\)</span> What is the area and moment of intertia about the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis? I need to calculate the mass and then the second moments. I do these integrals in cartesian coordinates.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
A \amp = \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-y^4}^{y^4}1 dx dy\\
\amp = \int_{-1}^1 2y^4 dy = \frac{2y^5}{5}
\Bigg|_{-1}^1 = \frac{4}{5}\\
I_x \amp = \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-y^4}^{y^4} y^2 dx dy\\
\amp = \int_{-1}^1 xy^2 \Bigg|_{-y^4}^{y^4} =
\int_{-1}^1 2y^6 dy = \frac{2y^7}{7} \Bigg|_{-1}^1
= \frac{4}{7}
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now I want to compare this lamina to a rectangle of height <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and width <span class="process-math">\(\frac{2}{5}\text{,}\)</span> which has the same area. I can quickly  calculate the moment of inertia for the rectangle.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
I_x = \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-\frac{1}{5}}^\frac{1}{5} y^2 dx
dy = \frac{4}{15}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The previous shape has twice the resitance to rotation compare with the rectangle, even though it has the same cross-section area. The reasons for the higher moment of intertia is that the area is distributed futher away from the origin; things that are farther away are harder to cause to rotate. This physical fact demonstrated in this example partially explains the use of <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> beams in construction: they have more resistance to twisting and shear forces than a rectangular cross-section beam of the same size or weight, since the material is distributed further away from the central axis of a twist or shear force.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-applications.html#example-89" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
