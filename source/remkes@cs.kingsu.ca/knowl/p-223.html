<div class="para">You might wonder why this little bit of physics didnâ€™t include torsion. There is one derivative to get to the tangent and a second derivative to get to the normal and the binormal. To calculate torsion requires the derivative of the binormal: this is three derivatives away from the original curve. Torsion only shows up as a third derivative. The above discussion of acceleration only used second derivatives; indeed, acceleration can only describe motion in a plane. To get torsion and motion that diverges from its osculating plan requires a third derivative.</div>
