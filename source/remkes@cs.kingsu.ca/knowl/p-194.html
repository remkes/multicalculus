<div class="para">I want to complete these definitions with interpretation. Iâ€™ve already spent some time on the unit tangent vector <span class="process-math">\(T(t)\text{.}\)</span> It represents the direction of movement of the curve at that point. The associated scalar is speed, measuring how fast the object is moving at this point in the curve. The normal vector <span class="process-math">\(N(t)\)</span> represents the direction of curvature. Curvature was a scalar, measuring how curved the curve is at this point. The normal vector adds to this scalar a direction, telling you which way the curve is turning. The two vectors <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> determine a plane.</div>
