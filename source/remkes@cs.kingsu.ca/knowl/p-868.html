<div class="para">The state of a physical system in quantum mechnics is measured by a function <span class="process-math">\(\Psi\text{,}\)</span> called a wave function. <span class="process-math">\(\Psi\)</span> itself is not exactly the probability density; quantum mechanics works with a <span class="process-math">\(\CC\)</span>-valued function, which adds another layer of complexity. With <span class="process-math">\(\CC\)</span>-valued functions, there is an operation called complex conjugation, which changes the sign of the imaginary piece of the function. It is written with a bar, so <span class="process-math">\(\bar{\Psi}\)</span> is the conjugate. Then, expectation values in quantum mechanics are given by the following integral, where <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is the domain of states and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a observable on that domain of states.</div>
