<div class="para">That said, there are two examples of the functions with multiple inputs and output that have already been consider: linear transformation in linear algebra and change of coordiantes functions. Both these examples treated function <span class="process-math">\(\RR^m
\rightarrow \RR^m\)</span> as transformations of space. The analysis of linear transformation in linear algebra implicit used this interpretation throughout: what does the linear algebra do to <span class="process-math">\(\RR^n\text{?.}\)</span> The determinant calculate the change on size and orientation. Invertibility wondered if the changes could be undone. The classification of types was all about rotations, projects and the like  things that happen to the ambient space. Change of variables functions were also about changing space by changing the coordinate descriptions. The Jacobians even used the same determinant idea to talk about the change in (local, infinitesimal) size under a change in variables.</div>
