<div class="para">Before I move on, I want to define a term for these three coordinate system (and other similar systems). All three of these coordinate systems are based around circle. Their utility comes from this; cartesian coordinates are not really good for anything with a circular structure. In cartesian coordinates, circles and spheres inevitably lead to annoying square roots in the calculations. These other coordinate systems simplify those calculations substantially. I want to use the fact that all of these systems involve circles (and thus angle and radii) to define a term that unites them.</div>
