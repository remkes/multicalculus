<div class="para">This is precisely the force of gravity. The gradient points in the direction of maximum increase in potential energy (directly outward from the origin) with magnitude <span class="process-math">\(\frac{GmM}{r^2}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the distance between the two objects. This is a common situation we will discuss in Calculus IV: many forces are the result of gradients of potential energy functions. These forces are called <dfn class="terminology">conservative forces</dfn>. Gravity, like these other forces, can be thought of as the tendency for objects to lower their potential energy as efficiently as possible.</div>
