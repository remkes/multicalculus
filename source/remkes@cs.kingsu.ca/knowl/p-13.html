<div class="para">I can think of an element of <span class="process-math">\(\RR^2\text{,}\)</span> say <span class="process-math">\((1,4)\text{,}\)</span> as both the point located at <span class="process-math">\((1,4\)</span> and the vector drawn from the origin to the point <span class="process-math">\((1,4)\text{,}\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-points-and-directions.html" title="Figure 1.1.8">FigureÂ 1.1.8</a>. Though these two ideas are distinct, I will frequently switch between them, often without explicitly saying so. Part of becoming proficient in vector geometry is becoming accustomed to the switch between the perspectives of points and directions.</div>
