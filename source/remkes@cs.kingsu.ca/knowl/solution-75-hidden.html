<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><div class="para">I cannot approach the whole annulus as one regions with fixed bounds in <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and variable bounds in the other.  However, I can make us of some symmetry. Sine is an odd function, so the value on the second quadrant should be the negative of the value on the first quadrant. The same is true on the third and fourth quadrants. All in all, the various pieces of the integral will cancel out and the integral will evaluate to zero. I admit, this is a bit of a tricky answer, since Iâ€™m getting out ot actually describing the annulus with bounds. But it is worth remembering that these integrals are (hyper)volumes and sometimes there are good geometric arguments to be made that help to avoid calculations.</div></div></body>
