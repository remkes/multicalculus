<div class="para">I can split this up into six different integrals, all of which are annoying to do. Integration by parts in each integral can remove the logarithmic part, leaving a rational function. Partial fractions can then deal with the rational functions.

Turns out it was a reasonable thing that I did so, since the numbers get quite miserable.</div>
