<div class="para">This limit depend on the choice of <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span> I can get infinitely many values (all between 0 and 1) out of this limit depending on which line I use to approach <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\text{.}\)</span> With all these possible answers, the limit cannot exist. It is interesting to try to visualize the graph: as the values get close to zero, there are pieces of the graph getting close to any number between <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-3d-graph2.html" title="Figure 3.2.7">FigureÂ 3.2.7</a> shows some of this behaviour: approaching from the front of figure leads to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> but approaching from the sides leads to larger numbers. (The graph is slightly flawed, due to the graphing algorithm. The two cliffs should meet, even though the graph shows a gap between them. Where the two cliffs meet is the line with all the problematic limits.)</div>
