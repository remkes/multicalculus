<div class="para">Though I am dealing with a sphere, the parabaloid is easier to describe in cylindrical coordinates, so I will use that system. The whole system is symetrical about the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> axis, so <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> can simply range from <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(2\pi\text{.}\)</span> The sphere is the outside range of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and the paraboloid is the inside range of <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> but both depend on <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span> I need equations for both. The sphere is <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2 +z^2 = 9\text{,}\)</span> which changes to <span class="process-math">\(r^2
+ z^2 = 9\text{.}\)</span> Solving for <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> gives <span class="process-math">\(r =
\sqrt{9-z^2}\text{.}\)</span> The parabaloid is <span class="process-math">\(z = r^2 - 3\text{,}\)</span> which simplifies to <span class="process-math">\(r = \sqrt{z+3}\text{.}\)</span> The range on <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> starts at <span class="process-math">\(-3\)</span> and ends at the point where the paraboloid and the sphere meet. In the two equations, I can isolate the replace <span class="process-math">\(r^2\)</span> to get <span class="process-math">\(z+3+z^2 = 9\text{,}\)</span> which is the quadratic <span class="process-math">\(z^2 + z - 6 = (z-3)(z+2)\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, the parabaloid and sphere meet at the <span class="process-math">\(z=2\)</span> plane and <span class="process-math">\(z=2\)</span> is the upper bound for <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span> The Jacobian is <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span>
