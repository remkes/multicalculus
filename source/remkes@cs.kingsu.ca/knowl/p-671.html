<div class="para">The function <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y) = a - \frac{a(|x-y| + |x+y|)}{2b}\)</span> over the interval <span class="process-math">\([-b.b] \times [-b,b]\)</span> describes a square pyramid with height <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and side length <span class="process-math">\(2b\text{.}\)</span> What is the volume of such a pyramid? Doing the integral directly is difficult with the various evaluations of the absolute value terms. I could try to simplify by integrating over one quarter of pyramid with the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,b] \times [0,b]\text{,}\)</span> then multiply by 4 to get the entire area. However, this doesnâ€™t solve the problem with the absolute value terms; over this quarter, there are still essentially two pieces of the function. I need to split the domain further into two regions: one where <span class="process-math">\(x&gt;y\)</span> and one where <span class="process-math">\(x\lt y\text{.}\)</span> In those regions, I can drop the abosolute value in the function and do a reasonable integral. In the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,b] \times [0,b]\text{,}\)</span> those two regions are triangles, so I need to integrate over triangles. Triangles are not intervals, so I need a new technique.</div>
