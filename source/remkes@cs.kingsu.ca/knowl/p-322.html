<div class="para">In <span class="process-math">\(\RR\text{,}\)</span> there were only two directions of approach: from the left and from the right. If the behaviour from both sides was the same, then the limit existed. In <span class="process-math">\(\RR^n\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(n
\geq 2\text{,}\)</span> there are infinitely many ways to approach any given point. I can approach along lines in infinitely many directions out from the point. Even more, I can approach along other paths, such as spiral paths or strange jagged paths. This makes it much more difficult to determine the behaviour and much more difficult to prove existence of various limits. However, I do have some good news. First, the definition of continuity remains the same.</div>
