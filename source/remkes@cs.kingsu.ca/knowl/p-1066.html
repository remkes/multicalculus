<div class="para">There are many ways to describe the force or gravity or the electromagnetic force. One of them is to describe changes in potential energy. Potential energy is a <em class="emphasis">scalar</em> that describes the state of an object with relation to another electromagnetic or massive object. State in terms of potential energy, force is understood at the tendency for object to minimize their potential energy as quickly as possible. That is, an object will move in the direction of greatest decrease. Thankfully, we already have a tool to describe the direction of greatest increase/decrease for a scalar field: the gradient. So, the fields of force I want to discuss are fields of force that can be described as gradients of some potential energy. There is a name for these vector fields.</div>
