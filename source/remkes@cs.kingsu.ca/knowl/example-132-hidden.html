Then I apply Gauss twice, once in each direction.  The first integral in the middle piece of the equation  is zero since <span class="process-math">\(\nabla \times F = 0\text{;}\)</span> this is just the integral of zero over a solid region in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">This tells me that I can actually change the surface of integration via Gauss’ theorem, at least when the field is incompressible. I’m not going to give a second argument for the same result, this time using Stokes’ theorem. Let <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> be the boundary of the circle, which is the same as the boundary of the windsock excet that the the curve must go in a different direction to match the orientation. (The negative sign reflects that change in direction and orientation.)</div>
