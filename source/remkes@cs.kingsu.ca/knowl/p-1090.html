<div class="para">This interaction <span class="process-math">\(F \cdot \gamma^\prime\)</span> tells us how the field and the direction of the curve interact at a point. However, I may want a more holistic understanding of what happens along the whole curve. In the process of moving along the curve, how does the field act? Does the field push the object along the curve (a positive influence) or does movement along the curve have to work hard to counteract the field? Or, perhaps, does the curve move perpendicularly to the field and there is no influence at all?</div>
