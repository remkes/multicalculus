<div class="para">In this mathematical object, I have written down four differential equations. This is the first presentation of Maxwellâ€™s equations. (This version is the presentation via differential operators; a second presentation will follow below). There are four equations: two for statics, which calculate divergence of the fields, and two for dynmanics, which calculate curl of the fields. Without fields, curl and divergence, such differential equations are impossible to state; therefore, the concepts of vector fields, curl and divergence were invented in order to be able to state the fundamental equations that govern electricity and magnetism. To determine the time behaviour of an electromagnetic system means solving these four differential equations for whatever initial conditions describe the system. (This is, in general, a very difficult problem).</div>
