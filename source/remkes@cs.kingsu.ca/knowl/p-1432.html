<div class="para">Isolated electric charges exit. If there is a charge at a point, I can just attach a value <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> to that point. <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is the conventional letter for charge and has units of coulombs. In the SI system, coulombs are a derived unit, since it was decided that current should be the fundamental unit. A coulomb is the same as an amp-second, written <span class="process-math">\(A\cdot s\text{.}\)</span> In addition to point charges, often there is a distribution of charge in a region. This can be described as a charge density, which is a scalar field <span class="process-math">\(\rho(x,y,z)\text{.}\)</span> Charge density has units of coulombs per cubic metre, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{C}{m^3}\)</span> or amp-seconds per cubic metre, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{A \cdot s}{m^3}\text{.}\)</span>
