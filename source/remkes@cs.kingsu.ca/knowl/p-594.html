<div class="para">The original Riemann integral was already a very difficult definition to actually work with. This multivariable version is even worse, since I haven’t specified how to actually do the sum over all <span class="process-math">\(k^n\)</span> subintervals. This is where I want to start: with a better understanding of this sum.  However, working to this understanding in full generality or <span class="process-math">\(\RR^n\)</span> at the start is very unwieldy, so I’ll start with a function <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y)\)</span> defined on an interval in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^2\text{.}\)</span> As noted before, In <span class="process-math">\(\RR^2\text{,}\)</span> I will write <span class="process-math">\(\Delta A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dA\)</span> instead of <span class="process-math">\(\Delta V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dV\text{,}\)</span> since the pieces of an interval in<span class="process-math">\(\RR^2\)</span> are rectangles and have area, not volume.</div>
