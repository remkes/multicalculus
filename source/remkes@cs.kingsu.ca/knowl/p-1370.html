<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> be the region inside the cylinder <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2 =
4\)</span> bounded below by the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> plane and above by the plane <span class="process-math">\(x+z=6\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(F = (x^2 + \sin z, xy + \cos z,
e^y)\text{.}\)</span> It would be challenging to calculate the flux of this field over the surface <span class="process-math">\(\del D\text{;}\)</span> I’d have to parametrize the surface, with its strange diagonal upper bound and then calculate the flux integral of this complicated field. Gauss’ theorem lets me calculate a triple integral instead. Conveniently, the divergence of this field is a much simpler expression that the original field.  (I do still need to deal with this strange diagonal upper bounds. I do this by switching to cylindrical coordinates, where this upper bounding plane becomes <span class="process-math">\(z = 6 - r \cos \theta\text{;}\)</span> I can use this equation as the upper bound for <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> in the triple integral.)</div>
