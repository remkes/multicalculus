<div class="para">A major goal of this course is extending the notion of the derivative to multivariable functions. For parametric curves, the previous idea of the derivative (measuring the slope of a tangent line) became the tangent vector instead. For scalar fields which depend on multiple inputs, the extension of the derivative is more difficult. In this and the following sections, Iâ€™m going to introduce a variety of different ways to extend the derivative, each trying to capture some aspect of the single variable derivative. The first extention is the partial derivative.</div>
