<div class="para">In the initial discussion on potential energy, you may have noticed some small confusion about increase and decrease. Gradient points in the direction of greatest increase. However, in the interpretations of phyics for forces, objects move in the direction of greatest decrease. There is a sign issue here. The terminology in this section is correct: if <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is a conservative with with <span class="process-math">\(F = \nabla f\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is its scalar potential. However, for the actual conservative forces in physics (gravitational and electromagnetic), to account for this sign difference, the force will be the negative gradient: <span class="process-math">\(F =
-\nabla f\)</span>
