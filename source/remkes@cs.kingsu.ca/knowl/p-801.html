<div class="para">This example it quite a tricky volume problem, but shows some clever use of polar coordinates. Assume there are three cylinders of radius <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> along each axis in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\text{.}\)</span> What is the volume of the intersection of all three cylinders? (This object is called the tricylinder Steinmetz solid). Setting up the geometry is difficult. I will integrate a volume over the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> plane. By symmetry, I can work with one 16th of the shape: the portion that lies above one 8th of the circle above the axis. The first 8th of the circle is described by the bounds <span class="process-math">\(\theta \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{4} \right]\)</span> in cylindrical coordinates. The <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-axis cylinder restricts the shape to the circle in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis cylinder is lower than the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis cylinder over this particular <span class="process-math">\(8th\)</span> or a circle, so the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis cylinder is the limit on height. What is that height function? The equation of the cylinder is <span class="process-math">\(y^2 + z^2 = R^2\text{.}\)</span> I can solve for <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> to get  <span class="process-math">\(z ^2 = R^2 - y^2 = R^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta\text{,}\)</span> writing <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in cylindrical coordinates. This determines a region of integration. I integrate constant <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and I remember to include the Jacobian.</div>
