<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">A very important example is gravity and potential energy. Here is the field describing the force (per unit mass) generated by a mass <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> at the origin.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
F = \frac{GM}{\sqrt{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^3}} (-x, -y, -z)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now consider an outward path <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t) = (t,t,t)\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(t \in [a,b]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b&gt;a&gt;0\text{.}\)</span> I’ll calculate the line integral.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\gamma^\prime \amp  = (1,1,1)\\
F(\gamma(t)) \amp = \frac{GM}{\sqrt{(3t^2)^3}} (-t,-t,-t)
= \frac{-GM}{t^2 3\sqrt{3}} (1,1,1)\\
F(\gamma(t)) \cdot \gamma^\prime(t) \amp = \frac{-3
GM}{t^2 3\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{GM}{t^2\sqrt{3}}\\
\int_{\gamma} F \cdot ds \amp = \int_b^a
-\frac{GM}{t^2\sqrt{3}} dt = -\frac{GM}{\sqrt{3}}
\int_a^b \frac{1}{t^2} dt\\
\amp = -\frac{GM}{\sqrt{3}} \left. \frac{-1}{t}
\right|_a^b = - \frac{GM}{\sqrt{3}} \left( \frac{1}{a} -
\frac{1}{b} \right)\\
\amp = \frac{GM(a-b)}{ab\sqrt{3}}

<div class="para">If the distances <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are large, but <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are close to each other, then the change <span class="process-math">\(a-b\)</span> is much more significant than the change in the term <span class="process-math">\(ab\)</span> in the denominator. If I set <span class="process-math">\(g =
\frac{GM}{\sqrt{3}ab}\)</span> and pretend this is locally constant (which is reasonable given the assumptions about the relative sizes of the distances), the line integral (approximately) evaluates to <span class="process-math">\(g(a-b)\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Now cecall that the field is defined as force per unit mass, so if it acts on a mass <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> the output of the line integral will be potential of <span class="process-math">\(mg(a-b)\text{.}\)</span> Finally, let me call the difference <span class="process-math">\(b-a\)</span> by the letter <span class="process-math">\(h\text{,}\)</span> indicating the ‘height’ gained in movement along this curve. The result then is <span class="process-math">\(-mgh\text{,}\)</span> which is almost the high-school physics result of <span class="process-math">\(-mgh\text{,}\)</span> the increase in potential energy, where <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is the change in height and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> the local acceleration due to gravity.</div> <div class="para">The only remaining difference is the negative sign. This relates to my previous discussion about directions of gradients. The force of gravity is the <em class="emphasis">negative</em> gradient of the potential energy, which introduces a sign adjustment to all the interpretations for potential energy. Mutliplying by <span class="process-math">\((-1)\)</span> to adjust for this sign discrepancy gives the desired result: the line integral represent the change in potential energey as the object moves along the curve. This example is archetypical for conservative force and will be expanded upon in the next section.</div></article></body>
