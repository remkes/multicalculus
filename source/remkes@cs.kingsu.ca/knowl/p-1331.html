<div class="para">The boundary of a parametric object is the boundary in terms of the parameter. For a curve, the boundary is the endpoints, indicated by where the parameter starts and stops. Moreover, the curve has a direction. The boundary should reflect that direction. Therefore, boundaries of parametric objects are oriented boundaries. Orientation is going to mean something slightly different in each dimension. For curves, orientation assigns signs to the end points. The starting point is labelled as negative and the ending point as positive, so that the curve proceeds from negative to positive. This also fits with the fundamental theorem of line integrals: the line integral of a conservative fields is the value of the potential at the end point (positive) minus the value of the potential at the starting point (negative).</div>
