<div class="para">By convention, this potential energy is negative. It approaches <span class="process-math">\(-\infty\)</span> in the limit at the origin, and approaches <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as the distance from the origin grows to <span class="process-math">\(\infty\text{.}\)</span> Iâ€™ll writ the gradient of this potential energy; I seperate it into two pieces, one of magnitude and one of diection (where direction is given by a unit vector).</div>

\nabla P = \frac{GmM}{\sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 +z^2)^3}} (x, y, z)

The gradient points in the direction of maximum increase in potential energy (directly outward from the origin) with magnitude <span class="process-math">\(\frac{GmM}{r^2}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the distance between the two objects. This is a common situation we will discuss in Calculus IV: many forces are the result of gradients of potential energy functions. These forces are called <dfn class="terminology">conservative forces</dfn>. Gravity, like these other forces, can be thought of as the tendency for objects to lower their potential energy as efficiently as possible.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-gradients.html#example-41" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
