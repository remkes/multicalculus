<div class="para">Consider the vector field <span class="process-math">\(F(x,y) = (-y,x)\text{,}\)</span> as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-vector-field3.html" title="Figure 9.2.3">Figure 9.2.3</a>, with its integral curves in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-vector-field3-curves.html" title="Figure 9.2.4">Figure 9.2.4</a>. These integral curves of <span class="process-math">\(F(x,y) =
(-y,x)\)</span> aren’t surprising. Looking just at the vector fields, I can clearly tell that the fluid is travelling in a circular paths. Mathematically, the circles are curves <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t) = (a \cos t, a \sin t)\)</span> for a parameter <span class="process-math">\(a &gt;
0\text{.}\)</span> I can calculate <span class="process-math">\(\gamma^\prime(t) = (-a\sin t, a
\cos t)\text{.}\)</span> Now, I can notice that the first component of the derivative, <span class="process-math">\(-a \sin t\text{,}\)</span> is the negative of the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> component of the curve. Likewise, the second component of the derivative is exactly the first component of the curve. Therefore, I can write <span class="process-math">\(\gamma^(t) =
(-y,x)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are the component of the curve. In this way, the derivative of the curve (expressed in the original component of the curve) and the vector field have the same expression. The tangents to the curve are the vectors in the vector field.</div>
