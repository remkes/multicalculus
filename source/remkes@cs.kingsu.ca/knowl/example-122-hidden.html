<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><div class="para">Consider a paddle with a roughly rectangular cross section 15cm wide and 30cm tall. Say it moves through the water in the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> direction with speed <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> I can reinterpret the situation by letting the water move with field <span class="process-math">\(F = (0,0,v)\)</span> in which the paddle is stationary. I can think of the force the paddle causes in terms of the flux of this field through the paddle.</div> <div class="para">Now, I can perform a paddle stroke directly perpendicular to the direction of movement or at an angle <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{.}\)</span> My question is: how does our forward force (hence flux) vary due to <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{?}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">If the paddle is angled at angle <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{,}\)</span> then it is represented as a surface with normal <span class="process-math">\((\sin \theta, 0, \cos
\theta)\text{.}\)</span> Therefore <span class="process-math">\(F \cdot N = v \cos \theta\text{.}\)</span> (I can make this calculation without even have to do all the formal details of parametrization, since only the normal is important. The paddle is a part of a plane, so it has a constant normal.) Then I calculate the flux integral.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\int_\sigma F \cdot N dA = \int_D V \cos \theta dA = v \cos
\theta \int_D 1 dA = 450 v \cos \theta
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Compared to the perpendicular force or <span class="process-math">\(450v\)</span> the force due to a paddle stroke at an angle is this original force multiplied by <span class="process-math">\(\cos \theta\text{.}\)</span> Cosine is the approprate result here: when there is no adjustment to the angle (<span class="process-math">\(\theta = 0\)</span>), cosine is <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and the full force is applied; when the paddle turned a full quarter turn, cosine is <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and there is no force at all.</div></article></body>
