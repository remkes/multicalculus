<div class="para">Alternatively, I could argue more directly from the definition of a unit vector. If <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> is a unit vector, its length can never change -- the length is fixed at one. If <span class="process-math">\(\gamma^\prime(t)\)</span> share any small direction with <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> (more formally, if the projection was non-zero), then there would be a portion of the tangent vector pointing in the direction of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t)\text{.}\)</span> This would indicate that there is change in the direction of the vector. Such a change would necessarily change the length of the vector; increasing it is the growth is aligned with the vector, and decreasing it is the growth is against the vector. Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\gamma^\prime(t)\)</span> cannot share any such small direction.  The projection of the latter onto the former must be zero, which is equivalent to them being perpendicular.</div>
