<div class="para">This leads me to an interesting and important point: energy is a fiction. In the mathematical models of Newtonian physics (leaving the subtleties of relativity and quantumn mechanics aside for now), things like mass, charge, distance and time are real, fixed quantities. They mean something about the physical universe. Energy is not like these. Energy is fiction we made up and set to an arbitrary reference level, because it leads to very nice explanations of movement (i.e. objects accelerate to minimize their potential energy). Whether energy is positive or negative, large or small in magnitude, doesnâ€™t matter to the system. There is no intrinsic energy. What is real is difference in energey, how much potential energy changes with position, how much kinetic energey changes with velocity (relatively, of course, to some fixed reference frame).</div>
