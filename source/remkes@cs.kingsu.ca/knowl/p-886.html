<div class="para">What does this mean? The <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> is the standard deviation: it measures how wide the probability is for each of the measurements. This can be thought of as error. If a <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> is very small, we have a very precise observable. If <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> is large, the possible values in a reasonable probabity are much larger. The product of these two <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span> is the product of the uncertain in the measurement of position and moment. This is the famous uncertainty princple. Because the operators do not commute, I canâ€™t measure them both precisely at the same time. That fact comes directly the the operator mathematics; this makes it intrinsic to this quantum mechanical model. The uncertainly is not a problem of measurement, but a mathematical fact of the systems.</div>
