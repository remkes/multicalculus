<div class="para">A similar calcluation can be done for the circle of radius <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(\gamma(t) = (a \cos t, a \sin t)\text{.}\)</span> If I repeat all the steps for the unit circle, I can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\kappa(t) = \frac{1}{a}\text{.}\)</span> Again, this is constant, which makes sense since the circle is equally curved at all points. However, it’s interesting to note that the curvature is <em class="emphasis">inversely</em> proportional to the radius.  A curvature value of <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\)</span> is interpreted as the curvature of a circle of radius <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{\kappa}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">This hopefully makes sense — a circle with a very large radius doesn’t locally have to curve very much. I know this very well, living on the surface of the earth: since the radius of the earth is large, I don’t really see the curvature of its surface. However, for circle with very small radius, there is less distance to cover a whole revolution, so the curvature must be larger.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-calculus-of-parametric-curves.html#example-24" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
