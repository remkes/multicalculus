<div class="para">For single variable integrals, substitution was used to change the integrand to make it more reasonable. For multiple integration, there is difficult both in the integrand and in the region of integration. I can use a change of variables to help us with either problem. Sometime, as in the following examples, the same transformation helps both. When I are choosing a change of variables to simplify the region of integration, I am looking for a change of variables where some of the non-constant bounding curves of the region become <span class="process-math">\(u=c\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(v=c\text{.}\)</span> This can let me setup reasonable bounds of integration for an integral over a complicated region.</div>
