<div class="para">Other than ignoring boundaries and smaller dimensional pieces, our approach to general sets is to break them up into pieces. It is a general result in topology, which we wonâ€™t get into here, that any (reasonable) set can be broken up in to pieces (possibly infinitely many) where the previous style of integral applies. We can also be creative: for example, we could integrate over a larger circle and subtract the integral over a small circle to integrate over a ring-shaped domain. In these various ways we can set up integrals over any (reasonable) subset of <span class="process-math">\(\RR^n\text{.}\)</span>
