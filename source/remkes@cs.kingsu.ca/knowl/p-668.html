<div class="para">This proposition means that we can ignore any inconveniences which happen on the boundaries of sets. (Note that we still do need limits for improper integrals, when the value of a function approaches <span class="process-math">\(\infty\)</span> near the boundary of a set). The proposition also means that sets which are essentially of lower dimensions do not matter in integration. If we are integrating over subsets of <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\text{,}\)</span> then integrating over points, line and planes amounts to nothing. Points, lines, and planes donâ€™t have any interior points in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\text{,}\)</span> so we might as well be integrating over the empty set, which gives zero.</div>
