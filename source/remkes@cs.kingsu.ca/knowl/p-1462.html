<div class="para">As I said above, actually solving Maxwell’s equations is very difficult. This is particularly true since all of the physical condition of the situation are build into the initial conditions of the differential equations, which can be very complicated. However, I could choose the easiest initial condition possible: none at all. <div class="para"></div> This train of through leads to a very strange question: what happens if I consider Maxwell’s equation in a vacuum with no external influence? There is nothing there, no charge, no current, no wires. However, the existence of electrical and magnetic fields in a vacuum is possible, so the differential equations still might have something to say. I’ll work with the first presentation of Maxwell’s equations here. I’ll see all the charge and current terms to zero, since there are no charge particles, no currents, and no magnets in a vacuum. Here are the resulting differential equations.</div>
