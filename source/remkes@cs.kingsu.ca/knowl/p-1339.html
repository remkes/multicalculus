<div class="para">For parametric curves, orientation always works: all curves have starting points, ending points, and movement from the start to the end. However, not all surfaces have reasonable orientation. Locally, orientation is always fine. In a small part of a surface, the normal will point to one side of the surface and a notion of above and below can be defined. But these local orientations may not fit together into an orientation that works for the entire surface. The classic example is the Möbius strip: a cylindrical ring with a single twist in it. This object does not have properly defined sides. Many other surfaces have similar problems. A surface that has a reasonable orientation over the whole surface is called <dfn class="terminology">orientable</dfn>. Surfaces which don’t, like the Möbius strip, are <dfn class="terminology">non-orientable</dfn>. The results of this section are going to rely on orientability.</div>
