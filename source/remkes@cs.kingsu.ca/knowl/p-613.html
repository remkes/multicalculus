<div class="para">An function defined on a closed interval has to include values on the boundary of the interval. Assuming the function is piecewise continuous (as if the habit in this course), this means that the function cannot diverge to infinity near the edge of the interval. However, an function which is only defined on an open interval can have any kind of behaviour near the boundaries, including diverging to infinity. I would like to be able to handle this kind of integral as well</div>
