<div class="para">As a final example for this section, I can prove a a nice theorem from physics. This is a fact that is used all through high school and first year physics: large objects (like stars, planets, etc) are treated as point masses for the purpose of the force of gravity. This fact seemed intuitive, but now I actually want to formally prove it. I canâ€™t, unfortunately, construct a general proof at this time, but I will prove it for the special case of a sphere.</div>
