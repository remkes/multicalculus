<div class="para">The first surfaces in the list of examples above did not have boundaries (the sphere, the cube, etc.) Such surfaces are called <dfn class="terminology">closed</dfn> surfaces. A closed surface will invariable define an inside and an outside. By convention, the outside is above and the inside is below; therefore, the normals to closed surfaces should always point outwards, not inward. These closed surfaces themselves form the boundary of solid region in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\text{.}\)</span> What is a solid region in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\text{?}\)</span> Again, a technical, formal definition is not what I want here. Instead, I’ll simply treat a solid region in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\)</span> as any set in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\)</span> whose boundary (now this is the actual topological boundary!) is a closed parametric surface. The solid cube has the hollow cube as its boundary; the solid sphere has the hollow sphere as its boundary; the solid cone has the hollow cone as its boundary; and so on. The solid region itself doesn’t have any orientation. However, the orientation on the closed surface boundary must point outward, matching the convention I already established.</div>
