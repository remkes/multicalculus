<div class="para">What is the relationship between the two presentations? How do I go from the equations above, with curls and divergences, to equations of flux? I apply Gauss’ and Stokes’ theorem to the first presentation of Maxwell’s equations. This is why Gauss’ and Stokes’ theorems were discovered and what made them so fundamental to the discipline.  They transform the equation of fields into equations of flux which can be measure more reasonable in laboratory situations.</div>
