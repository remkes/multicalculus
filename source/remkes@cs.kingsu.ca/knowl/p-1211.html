<div class="para">If the field and the normal point roughly in the same direction, then the field is passing through the surfaces, transversely, at that point. This is a strong positive reaction. If the field and normal have nearly opposite direction, then there is a strong negative reaction. The parametrization and the normal gives an orientation to the surface: there is a differnce (in sign) between moving through the surface with the normal or against the normal. I can think of this of choosing sides of the surface: say, moving from below to above is positive and moving from above to below is negative. Unlike a locus, a parametric surface has this orientation, this choice of above and below, intrinsically built into the definition.</div>
