<div class="para">Now I have (informal) notions of orientation for both parametric curves and parametric surfaces.  Typically, the boundary of an orientable parametric surface should be a parametric curve. How do the orientations interact? First, notice that the boundary of a parametric surface will always be a <dfn class="terminology">closed</dfn> curve; that is, a curve with the same starting and endoing point. (It could be multiple closed curves, such as the two circles that bound an open cylinder, but each bounding curve can be dealt with separately as a closed curve.) Even more, I can expect for reasonable surfaces that the boundary is a <dfn class="terminology">simple</dfn>, closed curve; that is, a closed curve with no self-intersection. Simple closed curves are cycles: they go around a loop. This loop could be smooth, like a circle or ellipse, or with sharp cornder, like a square or rectangle. I need a connection between the normal of the surface and the direction of the loop that forms its boundary.</div>
