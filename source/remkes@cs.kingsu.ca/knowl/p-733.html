<div class="para">The key relationship here is <span class="process-math">\(dx = h^\prime(u) du\text{:}\)</span> the derivative tells us the relationships between the differential terms. In Calculus III, I did all that work on extending the notion of the derivative. I came to the conclusion that the derivative measures (in local coordinates) the best linear approximation to the function. In one variable, that was just multiplication by a number. In several variables, though, that linear approximation was a matrix, called the Jacobian matrix. Let me recall the definition. (Iâ€™ll only state it for an equal number of input and output variables, since that is the case that I will use for extending substitution).</div>
