<div class="para">I want to make an archetype out of the fundamental theorem. To that end, Iâ€™m going to boil down the idea to this basic: the fundamental theorem relates integrals where there is a derivative on the right and a boundary on the left. In this context, I can ask for other similar results: what theorem relate integrals where there is some kind of differential operator on the left and some kind of set boundary on the right? In symbols, if <span class="process-math">\(Df\)</span> is some differential opreator and <span class="process-math">\(\del S\)</span> is the boundary of some set, I am looking for theorems that fit this archetype:</div>
