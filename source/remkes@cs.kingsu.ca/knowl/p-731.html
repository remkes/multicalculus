<div class="para">The standard single-variable process, where the old variable is the dependent variable, substitution was mostly about doing the chain rule in reverse. I would try to look for a form that resembled the chain rule, with the derivative of an inside function in the integrand. This isn’t a fruitful way to extend the idea to multiple integration, since the chain rule doesn’t extend in a way that applies to these integrals. In the process for trigonometric substitution, the substitution was more about changing the situation, turing other functions into trigonometric functions to use trig identities to solve integrals. This is a much more productive direction: substitution is a thing that changes the situation or functions involved to make a more reasonable integral.</div>
