<div class="para">In either case, there is an interaction of the field and the path. In the case of the leaf in the wind, the fields and the path work together. In the case of the person moving upwind, the field and the path are opposed. Iâ€™d like to measure this interaction. An integral curve was defined to be a curve where the tangent vector and the vector field coincided. For another curve, the tangetn vector and the vector field may not coincide, but they exist and I can look at their interaction. I have a tool for this: the dot product. The dot product measures the similarity of two vector, being largest when they are in the same direction, negative when the are in oppositve directions, and zero when they are perpendicular. Given an field <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> and a curve <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{,}\)</span> the dot product <span class="process-math">\(F \cdot
\gamma^\prime\)</span> will measure the interaction.</div>
