<div class="para">Some of the 19th century electro-magnetic observations directly measured charge, field and current, leading to the equations in the previous section. However, often the fields are difficult to measure directly; instead, their flux through various surfaces can be measured in the laboratory. Flux essentially measure the fields strength via particular apparatus in a laboratory. To that end, there is a second presentation of Maxwellâ€™s equations using the flux of fields, not just the fields themselves.</div>
