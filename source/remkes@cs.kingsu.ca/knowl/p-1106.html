<div class="para">In the previous section, I showed how to calculate line integral buy doing a single-variable integral where the variable of integration was the curve parameter. The new kind of integral, a line integral, was reduced to a single-variable integral which we already understand from single-variable calculus. This mirrors the approach from earlier sections in this course. For integration over two, three and higher dimensional region, the method of calculation was iterated integras, which reduce the problem to a series of understood single-variable integrals.</div>
