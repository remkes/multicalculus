<div class="para">I’ve presented two main theorems here. In many texts, there are three important theorems presented in the matching section . Historically as well, there were three theorem in this development of this theory. I only presented two theorems since the third theorem is actually just a special case of Stokes’ Theorem. It is called Green’s theorem and it applies to <span class="process-math">\(\RR^2\text{;}\)</span> it is a special case of Stokes’ Theorem because if you calculate Stokes’ theorem and set the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> coordinates of everything to zero (thus essentially working in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^2\text{,}\)</span> the result is exactly Green’s Theorem. I will, however, state it here.</div>
