<div class="para">The existence of multiple parametrization for parametric curves is an example of a very general trend in abstract mathematics. A mathematical structure is some kind of pattern or behaviour (such as a curve being a particular path through space). This pattern can be presented in a variety of ways (such as a variety of parametrizations). This always presents a fundamental difficulty: if you want to understand something about the general pattern -- about the mathematical structure in itself -- you need to make sure that your observations transcend the particularities of the presentation. Sometimes, there is a special presentation (such as the parametrization by arclength) which serves as the ideal model of the structure. Where there is such a presentation, mathematicians make heavy use of it. Where no such presentation exists (which is usually the case), mathematicians always have to struggle with the tension between pattern itself and how the pattern is presented.</div>
