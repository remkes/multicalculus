<div class="para">Let me make a couple of points aobut this definition. First, because I’m using the cross product, this definition only works in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3\text{.}\)</span> There are notions of tangents and normals to parametric surfaces in higher dimensions, but more machinery is needed to define these tangents and normals. To do so moves in to the study of differentiable manifolds. Second, I can think of the <span class="process-math">\(C^1\)</span> condition saying that the parametric curve has no sharp corners (and no singularities of the parametrization, which I’ll discuss in examples later). A natural term for having no sharp concers would be ‘smooth’. Unfortunately, this has a slightly different definition. A <dfn class="terminology">smooth parametric surface</dfn> (alternatively a <span class="process-math">\(C^\infty\)</span> parametric surface) is a parametric surface where all higher partial derivatives, of any degree, exist and where the normal is never zero. For the purpose of this course, most of the surface I introduce will be smooth; I could use this terminology if I wanted, saying ‘smooht’ instead of ‘<span class="process-math">\(C^1\)</span> and non-singular’. However, only <span class="process-math">\(C^1\)</span> is required for the definition of the normal.</div>
