<div class="para">Almost all sets we will work with are integrable. Sets which are not integrable are very strange sets (at least, for doing anything geometric). The archetypical example is <span class="process-math">\(\QQ \subset \RR\text{:}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\QQ\)</span> is not an integrable subset of <span class="process-math">\(\RR\text{.}\)</span> What does is mean, for a single variable function, to integrate over all rational points but not over the irrational points? Since the rational and irrational points are everywhere in <span class="process-math">\(\RR\text{,}\)</span> there is no notion of ‘area under a curve’ here at all. This integral doesn’t make any sense; the set it not an integrable set. Equivalently, the Riemann integral limit doesn’t not converges, since you can always choose rational or irrational <span class="process-math">\(x_k^*\text{;}\)</span> the different choices lead to different values of the limit for these choices, so the integral doesn’t work.</div>
