<div class="para">This is called an elliptic integral (of the second kind, technically). It was a major motivator in 19th century mathematics, since the circumference of the ellipse was considered an important geometric problem. It led, indirectly, to the objects known as elliptic curves. These are very important geometric object which seem strangely named, since they donâ€™t look like they have anything to do with ellipses. The connection is these integrals. Elliptic curves were invented as part of some clever and complicated new methods to approach ellitpic integrals. In this sense, elliptic curves are not curves which are like ellipses, but rather, curves that solve some elliptic integrals.</div>
