<div class="para">There are a couple things to note about this definition. First, <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\)</span> is the greek letter kappa, even though it looks like the Englith ‘k’. Second, <span class="process-math">\(T(s)\)</span> is a vector, so the derivative <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dT(s)}{ds}\)</span> is a vector derivative — the derivative is taken in each component of the vector. Curvature is the scalar length of the resulting vector. Finally, the unit tangent is the direction of motion. Therefore, the derivative of the unit tangent measure the change in direction. The length of this derivative is a scalar measure of how quickly direction is changing. (Note that thought <span class="process-math">\(|T(s)|
= 1\text{,}\)</span> there is no reason to expect that <span class="process-math">\(|T^\prime(s)| =
1\text{;}\)</span> the magnitude of the change in a unit vector can be any possible magnitude.)</div>
