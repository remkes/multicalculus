<div class="para">Each differential equation can be solved directly. These are seperable differential equation, but I can also simply notice that these are the basic exponential equation. Therefore, the solutions must be exponential function. Each exponential function will have an unknown starting value. Here are the solutions.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\gamma_1^\prime \amp = \gamma_1 \implies \gamma_1(t) =
ae^t\\
\gamma_2^\prime \amp = \gamma_2 \implies \gamma_2(t) =
be^t\\
\gamma_3^\prime \amp = \gamma_3 \implies \gamma_3(t) =
ce^t

<div class="para">The values of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> will be determined by the starting point of the parametric curve. As with all differential equation, initial conditions determine the unknown constant in the solution. This also gives the entire family of integral curves by making all the possible independent choices for these three constants.</div></article></body>
