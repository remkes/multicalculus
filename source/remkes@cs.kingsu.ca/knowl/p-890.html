<div class="para">Historically, there were three main camps. The Realist camp claimed that things existed in reality and that probability is an illusion and weakness of the model. The Orthodox camp said that nothing exists before a measurement. The system <em class="emphasis">is</em> a probabilityâ€“nothing more or less. The Agnostic camp said that before measurement, any such question is meaningless, since measurement is all we have to interact with the universe.
