<div class="para">The line integral is a measure of work or resitance of the field along the path. If the integral is positive then, on average, the field is working along with the curve. If the integral is negative then, on average, the curve is moving against the field. The integral curves of the field are the curves where the tangents of the curve and the field coincide: these are the curves that have the largest positive line integrals. As before, I should repeat a caution about the interpretation. Sometimes, curve are thought of as the paths objects take due to the action of the field (such as the integral curve, for objects starting at rest). However, sometimes curves are representing objects under some other volition, which may act with or against the fields; the line integral then measures the interaction.</div>
