<div class="para">I want to make on final comments about the <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> Jacobian for polar coordinates. In cartesian coordinates, both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> have unit of length. Therefore, the differential <span class="process-math">\(dx
dy\)</span> has units of (infinitesimal) area, as it should for integration. (Recall we wrote this as <span class="process-math">\(dA\)</span> when we were working in general, without specific coordinates). However, in polar coordinates, <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> has units of distance, but <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> has no units. (Radian angles can naturally be define as ratio of distances; the units cancel in the fraction and an angle has no natural unit.). Therefore, the differential <span class="process-math">\(dr d\theta\)</span> has units only of distance. This doesnâ€™t make sense for integration, since this should be an infinitesimal area. The term with the Jacobian determinant is <span class="process-math">\(r dr
d\theta\text{;}\)</span> the additional <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> gives this units of area.</div>
