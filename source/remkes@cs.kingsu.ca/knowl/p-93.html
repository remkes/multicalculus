<div class="para">The major goal of this course is the extension of calculus to multivariable function. A parametric curve is a function with multiple outputs; these outputs are coordinates of position in some euclidean space depending on time; as such, parametric curves are used to talk about motion through space. The calculus of parametric curves is a way to understand the physics of such motion, covering both linear and angular velocity and acceleration in a nice, holistic approach.  When considering parametric curves, I like to imagine the movement of point-like objects through space under the influence of various forces. Projectiles with gravity and air friction is one imporant example; flying objects such as insect, bird or helicopter is a seond; the motions of planets, moons and satellite under gravity is a third.</div>
