<div class="para">I want to start with a summary of the experimental results that inspired this mathematics. This list below comes from people experimenting in laboratories and workships. Once it was understood how electricity could be generated and stored, people were playing around with various machines to see how electricity behaved.  Magnets, of course, have been used since antinquity, but new methods of understanding how magnets worked were being developed at the same time. I’ll start with observations of electricty and magnetism as two separate things. (Note that all the sign conventions are arbitrary. What observers decided was ‘positivie’ or ‘negative’ is just a choice of conventions. The opposite choice could have been made and also would have produced consistent mathematical models.)</div>
