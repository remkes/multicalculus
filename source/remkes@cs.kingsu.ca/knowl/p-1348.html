<div class="para">Finally, let me remind you about a term defined in previous courses. A curve is called <dfn class="terminology">piecewise differentiable</dfn> if it is differentiable except for isolated points. A piecewise differentiable curve is allowed to have isolate places with sharp corners. The boundary of a rectangle is a good example: it is differentiable everywhere except for the four corners of the rectangle. Line integrals of piecewise differentiable curves are well defined: I just do the line integral over the pieces and add up all the results.</div>
