<div class="para">This can be demontrated by talking about motion that is confined to circles. Say there is an object in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^2\)</span> that is restricted to a circe of a particular radius <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> It lives on the locus which is that circle. Applications will often want a description of this locus, to solve problems of movement, intersection, force, etc. To describe the circle in normal cartesian coordinates, I use the equation <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2 = R^2\text{.}\)</span> This isn’t a terrible description, but it’s also not the easier description; we may need square roots to solve for individual variables when we use this locus, for example. However, in polar coordinates, the locus of the circle is just <span class="process-math">\(r=R\text{.}\)</span> This is as simple as it gets. The coordinate system suits the task.</div>
