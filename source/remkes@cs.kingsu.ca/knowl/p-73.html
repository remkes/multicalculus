<div class="para">Finally, a plane can be determined by three points (as long as the three points do not all lie on the same line). If I am given three points (<span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span>), then I can use <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> as the local origin and construct the local direction vectors as <span class="process-math">\(q-p\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r-p\text{.}\)</span> Then I can proceed as in the previous step: the normal is the cross product of the two local direction, <span class="process-math">\((q-p)
\times (r-p)\text{.}\)</span> Finally, I finish with the first step, using the normal and a point to find the constant <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> Note, with this data, I have three points to chose from for this final step. All three should work and produce the same constant. If they fail to do so, that means there is an error earlier in the work somewhere. Iâ€™ll do an example to show all the steps.</div>
