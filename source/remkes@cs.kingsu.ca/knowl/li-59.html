<div class="para">This is an impossible integral to solve with the methods in this course, or even with more advanced method. Without <span class="process-math">\(e=0\text{,}\)</span> I can’t make use of a trig identity to remove all the trig functions. I am left with this annoying <span class="process-math">\(\cos^2 t\)</span> function inside the integral.  No substitution works, since there are no trig functions outside the integral.</div>
<div class="para">This is called an elliptic integral (of the second kind, technically). It was a major motivator in 19th century mathematics, since the circumference of the ellipse was considered an important geometric problem. It led, indirectly, to the objects known as elliptic curves. These are very important geometric object which seem strangely named, since they don’t look like they have anything to do with ellipses. The connection is these integrals. Elliptic curves were invented as part of some clever and complicated new methods to approach ellitpic integrals. In this sense, elliptic curves are not curves which are like ellipses, but rather, curves that solve some elliptic integrals.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="week2-activity.html#li-59" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
