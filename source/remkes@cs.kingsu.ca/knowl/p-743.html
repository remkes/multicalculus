<div class="para">This Jacobian shows that the radius term gives the effect on area. This make sense: for larger circles, the differential area is part of a larger arc. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/figure-polar-jacobian.html" title="Figure 8.1.5">Figure 8.1.5</a> illustrates this. There are two regions; each region has the same increase in radii between the inside and outside of the region, and each region has the same inscribed angle. However, the two regions clearly have a different area: a region with the same ‘width’ (different in radius) and the same ‘height’ (difference in angle) is a larger region the further out it is on the circle.  Ths figure shows this at a marcoscopic level; the Jacobian is essentially measuring the same reality at an infinitesimal level. The Jacobian multiplies by the radius term <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> to indicate this scaling of area as the radius increases.</div>
