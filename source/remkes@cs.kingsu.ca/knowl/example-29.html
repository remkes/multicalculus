<div class="para">I’ll start with at the domains of the five explicitly stated functions in the Example <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/example-multivariable1.html" title="Example 3.1.4">Example 3.1.4</a>.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(f_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f_4\)</span> are polynomials (in two variables), so there are no restrictions. Their domain is <span class="process-math">\(\RR^2\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(f_2\)</span> is a sine function, which again imposes no restrictions, so it also has domain <span class="process-math">\(\RR^2\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(f_5\)</span> has two square roots, one involving <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and one involving <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(x\geq 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y \geq 0\)</span> are necessary to define <span class="process-math">\(f_5\text{.}\)</span> That domain is the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> quadrant, including the origin and the positive pieces of both axes.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(f_6\)</span> also has a square root. To ensure that the square root has a positive argument, I require <span class="process-math">\(4 -
x^2 - y^2 \geq 0\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2 \leq 4\text{.}\)</span> This domain is a a circular disc of radius <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> including its boundary.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Lastly, <span class="process-math">\(f_3\text{,}\)</span> has an strange exponential. This leads to very strange domain behaviour. If <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is an integer, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> can be any non-zero real number. If <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is a fraction, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> must be positive if the denominator of <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is even, to avoid square roots of negative numbers. If <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is irrational, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> must be positive. This all leads to a very complicated domain in <span class="process-math">\(\RR^2\text{,}\)</span> something hard to describe directly as a shape.</div></li>
