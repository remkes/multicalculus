<div class="para">The previous shape has twice the resitance to rotation compare with the rectangle, even though it has the same cross-section area. The reasons for the higher moment of intertia is that the area is distributed futher away from the origin; things that are farther away are harder to cause to rotate. This physical fact demonstrated in this example partially explains the use of <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> beams in construction: they have more resistance to twisting and shear forces than a rectangular cross-section beam of the same size or weight, since the material is distributed further away from the central axis of a twist or shear force.</div>
