<div class="para">Through the discussion of vector fields, which last for most of the remainder of the course, I will rely heavily on two applications: fields of force and fields describing fluid flow. These two applications are fundamental to the theory. Between them, they can help ground the difficult abstration of the discipline. For fields of force, gravity is often the first example  indeed, I used it above. However, electromagnetic force will end up being the more important example. Historically, the development of the theory of vector fields was driven by 19th century attempts to understand electricity and magnestism. Many of the basics of gravitational action can be understood with scalar calculus, as Newton did in his physics. However, eletricity and magnetism are difficult to even start describing without vector fields.</div>
