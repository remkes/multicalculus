<div class="para">The indefinite integral <span class="process-math">\(\int f dx\)</span> was a notation for <em class="emphasis">all</em> anti-derivatives of the single-variable function. Is there a multivariable version of this anti-derivative? Calculus III tried to extend the derivative to multi-variable functions. The result was a collection of construction: partial derivatives, tangent (hyper-)planes, gradients and the Jacobian matrix. However, none of these notions of the derivative gave a new multi-variable funciton. Therefore, there isn’t a nice notion of anti-derivative: going back doesn’t make sense, since going forward led to more complicated constructions. If <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y,z)\)</span> is a scalar field, then <span class="process-math">\(\int f\)</span> doesn’t have any clear meaning.</div>
