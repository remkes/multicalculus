<div class="para">This is a slightly strange extension of the single-variable chain rule. Originally, the chain rule was for any composition. However, the chain rule is very specifically for the composition of a scalar field with a parameteric curve. However, upon reflection, you could realize that this is really the only possibility. If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> are both functions <span class="process-math">\(\RR^3 \rightarrow \RR\text{,}\)</span> then the composition <span class="process-math">\(f \circ
g\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(g \circ f\)</span> isnâ€™t even defined. The output of the first function is a scalar, but the input needs to be a vector. The only reasonable composition with a scalar field is to compose with a parametric curce, since a parametric curve outputs a vector. In Calculus IV, I will introduce  vector fields which could allow for other compositions, but for now, this is the only possibility.</div>
