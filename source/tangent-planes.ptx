    <title>Generalizing Tangents</title>
    <p>
      In single variable calculus, derivatives calculated the slopes
      and equations of tangent lines to the graph of a function. I
      want to extend this idea. For functions of two variables, graphs
      are surfaces in <m>\RR^3</m> instead of curves in <m>\RR^2</m>.
      These surfaces have tangent planes instead of tangent lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider a function <m>f(x,y)</m> and look at a particular point
      <m>(a,b,f(a,b))</m> on the graph of the function. I can
      calculate the partial derivatives <m>f_x(a,b)</m> and
      <m>f_y(a,b)</m>. At the point <m>(a,b,f(a,b))</m>, these two
      partial derivatives calculate the rate of change in <m>x</m> and
      in <m>y</m>. That's the slope of a tangent line in the <m>x</m>
      direction and a tangent line in the <m>y</m> direction. I'd
      rather have direction vectors than slopes, but I can construct
      these. For the <m>x</m> direciton, the <m>y</m> coordinate is
      <m>0</m> since there is no change in <m>y</m>. That gives the
      vector <m>(1, 0, f_x(a,b))</m>.  Likewise in the <m>y</m>
      direction, we have the vector <m>(0,1,f_y(a,b))</m>. These are
      two local tangent direction vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given two vectors on a plane, the normal of the plane is
      found by the cross product. So I calculate <m>(1,0, f_x(a,b))
      \times (0,1, f_y(a,b)) = (-f_x(a,b), -f_y(a,b),1)</m>. This
      leads to the following result. 
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="proposition-tangent-plane">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x,y)</m> be a function <m>\RR^2 \rightarrow
          \RR</m>. The equation of the tangent plane to <m>f</m> at
          <m>(a,b,f(a,b))</m> is
          <me>
            z - f(a,b) = f_x(a,b) (x-a) + f_y(a,b) (y-b)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        I just calculated the normal at any point <m>(a,b,f(a,b))</m>
        on the graph of the function. That vector was <m>(-f_x(a,b),
        -f_y(a,b),1)</m>. The equation of the plane
        is given by the dot product of the variables with the normal.
        Here is this dot product, with an unknown value <m>c</m>.
        <me>
          - f_x(a,b) x - f_y(a,b) y + z = c
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        I already know a point on the plane: <m>(a,b,f(a,b))</m>. By
        substitution, I can solve for <m>c</m>.
        <me>
          c = f(a,b) - f_x(a,b) a - f_y(a,b) b
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting this <m>c</m> in gives the equation of the plane.
        <me>
          - f_x(a,b) x - f_y(a,b) y + z = f(a,b) - f_x(a,b)a -
          f_y(a,b)b
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        From here, is it just a re-arrangement to get the form in the
        proposition.

    <p>
      The definition of tangent planes for <m>f: \RR^2 \rightarrow
      \RR</m> extends to many dimensions. A function
      <m>f: \RR^3 \rightarrow \RR</m> has a graph in <m>\RR^4</m>.
      Its tangent spaces are 3-spaces in <m>\RR^4</m>. I can
      understand those 3-spaces in a very similar method. I
      calcluate the three local tangent directions.

      To connect tangent (hyper)planes to tangents to parametric
      curves and derivatives along those curves, consider the following
      result.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma(t)</m> be a parametric curve in
          <m>\RR^{n+1}</m> and <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> a
          differentiable function. Then if <m>\gamma(t)</m> lies on
          the graph of <m>f</m>, the tangents to <m>\gamma(t)</m> must
          lie on the tangent planes to the graph of <m>f</m>. (All
          these tangent vectors are local direction vectors).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the same function as <xref
          ref="example-tangent-plane">Example</xref>: <m>f(x,y) =
          \frac{1}{1+x^2+y^2}</m>. Then consider the parametric
          curves <m>\gamma_1(t) = \left(t,1, \frac{1}{2+t^2}
          \right)</m> and <m>\gamma_2(t) = \left(1, t, \frac{1}{2+t^2}

          the graph of <m>f</m> and both pass through the point
          <m>\left(1,1,\frac{1}{3} \right)</m> at <m>t=1</m>. Then I
          can calculate the tangents to the curves at that point and
          the plane they span.

          This gives exactly the same normal at the same point
          <m>\left( 1,1,\frac{1}{3} \right)</m>, so the same plane. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a key idea here, relating tangent planes for scalar
          fields to the calculus of parameteric curves from <xref
          ref="section-calculus-of-parametric-curves" />. A curve can
          lie on the graph of a function as long as the components of
          the curve satisfy the function: <m>z(t) = f(x(t),y(t))</m>.
          The above calculation was an example of the tangent of these
          curves. Their tangent vectors ended up being local direction
          vectors that lived in the tangent plane of the scalar
          fields. This can be a conceptual definition of the tangent
          plane: the tanget plane is the environment which is home to
          tangent to curves which lie on the graph of the function.
