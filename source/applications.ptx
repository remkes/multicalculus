    <title>Definitions for Mass and Moments</title>
    <p>
      I've done a bunch of volume calculations so far. Similar but
      more practical is the calculation of the mass of a solid object.
      If the object has a fixed desnity, then its mass is just this
      constant density multiplied by volumes. However, sometimes 
      density is variables. The first application I want to introduce
      for multiples integrals is calculating the mass of an object
      with variable density.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\rho(x,y,z)</m> is a density function, integrable on a
          region <m>S \in \RR^3</m>, the <term>mass</term> of the
          object <m>S</m> is found from by integrating the density
          function.
        </p>
        <me>
          m = \int_S \rho dV
        </me>
        <p>
          This can also be done in <m>\RR^2</m> for flat objects with
          variable density depending on only <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
          Such objects are normally refered at laminae (the singular
          is lamina).

      A similar interesting physical problem is the problem of centre
      of mass. The centre of mass of an rigid object (or system) is
      the point in space where linear forces on the object can be
      accuratly modeled as forces on a point-mass. In particular,
      forces on the centre of mass do not cause rotational
      acceleration. The calculation of centre of mass involves the
      calculation of so-called first moments. These definition vary
      by dimension. First I will defined moments for a lamina in
      <m>\RR^2</m>.

      Centre of mass and first moments are important physical
      properties that deal with linear acceleration; for the purpose
      of linear acceleration, the object acts like a point-mass at the
      centre of mass. However, there are also moments involved in
      rotational movement and acceleration. These are called second
      moments or moments of intertia.

          Now I want to compare this lamina to a rectangle of height

          can quickly  calculate the moment of inertia for the

        <me>

        <p>
          The previous shape has twice the resitance to rotation
          compare with the rectangle, even though it has the same
          cross-section area. The reasons for the higher moment of
          intertia is that the area is distributed futher away from
          the origin; things that are farther away are harder to cause
          to rotate. This physical fact demonstrated in this example
          partially explains the use of <m>I</m> beams in
          construction: they have more resistance to twisting and
          shear forces than a rectangular cross-section beam of the
          same size or weight, since the material is distributed
          further away from the central axis of a twist or shear
          force.

          calculate all the properties here: mass, centre of mass, and
          moments of inertia. Since I am calculating over a
          hemisphere, I'll be using spherical coordinates. Wherever
          possible, I'll use symmetry to simplify things. In
          particular, for first moments, if the mass is equally
          distributed on either side of an axis, that moment must be
          zero due to symmetry.

          Now consider a parabaloid bounded by <m>z = b(x^2 + y^2)</m>
          with height <m>h</m> and density <m>\rho = 1</m>. What are
          its moments of inertia? I will use cylindrical coordinates,
          which are well suited to describe the parabaloid. However, I
          need a bound on the radius term at the height <m>h</m>. The
          equation of the parabaloid in cylindrical coordinates is
          <m>z = br^2</m> and when <m>z=h</m>, I see that <m>r =
          \sqrt{\frac{h}{b}}</m>. This is the outer bound on radius.
          With contstant bounds on angle and radius, I can let
          <m>z</m> range from the parabaloid graph <m>z=br^2</m> to
          the constant height <m>h</m>.

      As a final example for this section, I can prove a a nice
      theorem from physics. This is a fact that is used all through
      high school and first year physics: large objects (like stars,
      planets, etc) are treated as point masses for the purpose of the
      force of gravity. This fact seemed intuitive, but now I actually
      want to formally prove it. I can't, unfortunately, construct a
      general proof at this time, but I will prove it for the special
      case of a sphere. 
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A body of uniform density under the action of a external
          conservative force (such a gravity) acts like a point mass
          at its centre of mass.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        I'll just prove the theorem for the special case of a
        sphere. The force of gravity between two masses <m>m_1</m>
        and <m>m_2</m> is
        <me>
          F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll assume the source of the gravitational attraction sits
        at <m>(0,0,c)</m> where <m>c \gt a</m> is larger than <m>a</m>
        the radius of the sphere. I'll also assume that <m>\rho</m>
        is the constant density of the sphere. Then <m>\rho dV</m> is
        an infinitesimal piece of mass in the sphere, and I can write
        <m>\omega</m> for the distance from the infinitesimal mass to
        the gravitational source.
      </p>
      <p>
        The force on the infinitesimal mass is
      </p>
      <me>
        F dV = \frac{Gm\rho dV}{\omega^2}
      </me>.
      <p>
        I'll write this in polar coordinates. 
      </p>
      <me>
        F dV = \frac{Gm\rho r^2 \sin \phi dr d\phi d\theta}{\omega^2}
      </me>.
      <p>
        By symmetry of the sphere, all lateral forces will cancel. I
        only care about the <m>z</m> component of the force. Let
        <m>\alpha</m> be the angle from the <m>z</m> axis of the line
        from <m>(0,0,c)</m> to the infinitesimal mass. Then I can
        rewrite the force again.
      </p>
      <me> 
        F_z dV = \frac{Gm\rho r^2 \sin \phi \cos \alpha dr d\phi
        d\theta}{\omega^2}
      </me>
      <p>
        Now I'll do some trigonometry. Consider the triange with
        vertices <m>(0,0,c)</m>, <m>(0,0,0)</m> and the location of
        our infinitesimal mass. The angle at <m>(0,0,c)</m> is
        <m>\alpha</m> by definition, and likewise the angle at
        <m>(0,0,0)</m> is <m>\phi</m>. The side lengths are <m>c</m>,
        <m>\omega</m> and <m>r</m>, also by definition. I will also
        use the cosine law.

        The length <m>c</m> along the <m>x</m> axis can be divided
        into two pieces, so that <m>c = \omega \cos \alpha + r \cos

        Now I can replace both <m>\cos \alpha</m> and <m>\omega</m>in the

      </me>
      <p>
        I'll do some substitution here, more or less reversing the
        trigonometry. I leave <m>r</m> and <m>\theta</m> alone, but
        write <m>\omega^2 = r^2 + c^2 - 2rc\cos\phi</m> with the
        cosine law as before.

      <p>
        The bounds are <m>\omega(0) = c-r</m> and <m>\omega(\pi) =

        The expression in brackets is the mass of the sphere and
        <m>c</m> is the distance from the centre of mass to the
        gravitational sources. This is exactly the expression we
        wanted: it is the force due to a point mass at the origin with
        mass equal to the total mass of the sphere.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      In the proof, the two masses were seperated from each
      other. I could instead consider hollow sphere, with outside
      radius <m>a</m> and inside radius <m>b</m>, and a point mass at
      <m>(0,0,c)</m> with <m>c\lt b</m>, so that the point mass is
      inside the sphere. What is the force of gravity on that point
      mass? The set-up is almost the same; the only difference is
      that the bounds on <m>\omega</m> are reversed in sign. Let me do
      the final calculation with this adjustment.

          A <term>probability distribution</term> on an integrable set

          \int_D \rho dV = 1
        </me>.
        <p>
          The set <m>D</m> is called the <term>set of states</term>;
          each point represents the state of the system. For any
          integrable subset <m>A \subset D</m>, the probability that
          the state of the system is in the subset <m>A</m> is the
          integral over that subset.

      <statement>
        <p>
          An integrable function <m>f: D \rightarrow \RR</m> is called
          an <term>observable</term> or <term>measurable</term>; for
          each state, an observable measure some property of that
          state. The <term>expectation value</term> of the observable
          <m>f</m> is the continuous version of the average value of
          <m>f</m> over the state. It is written <m>\langle

      each coordinate, using the definition.

      The first three of these are the expectation values of each
      coordinate of position and the last is the expectation value of
      the distance to the origin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, with <m>D \subset \RR^3</m>, <m>\rho</m> could be
      an ordinay mass-density. I can think of this as the
      probability of finding mass at each point in the set. In that
      context, <m>\langle x\rangle</m>, <m>\langle y\rangle</m> and
      <m>\langle z\rangle</m> are just the first moment and the
      coordinates of the centre of mass. That also makes sense: the
      centre of mass is the <sq>average</sq> location of the mass of
      the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second moments are also expectation values. For example,
      <m>\langle x^2 + y^2\rangle</m> is the average (square) distance
      from the <m>z</m> axis. Objects further away from the <m>z</m>
      axis are more difficult to rotate around that axis, so this
      naturally measure the resistance to rotation around the <m>z</m>
      axis. Likewise for <m>\langle x^2 + z^2\rangle</m> about the
      <m>y</m> axis and <m>\langle y^2 + z^2\rangle</m> about the
      <m>x</m> axis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of the term <sq>moment</sq> is historical. The entire
      subject of continuous probability can be developed using the
      terminology of moments. For the rest of  notes, I'll use the
      term <sq>expectation value</sq> instead of <sq>moment</sq>.

          The standard deviation of a observable is a measure of the
          width of the distribution. It can be expressed as the
          expectation value of the distance from the average. In
          practice, I use the square of distance and calculate the
          square of standard deviation (much like the pythagorean
          theorem). Let <m>f</m> be a observable. Its standard
          deviation <m>\sigma_f</m> is calculate by the following

    <title>Quantum Mechanics</title>
    <p>
      One of the most well-known applications of continuous
      probability is quantum mechanics. The whole field is built on
      the assumption that states of physical systems are
      probabilistically determined and that we should study the
      physics of the system by studying the probability distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of a physical system in quantum mechnics is measured
      by a function <m>\Psi</m>, called a wave function. <m>\Psi</m>
      itself is not exactly the probability density; quantum mechanics
      works with a <m>\CC</m>-valued function, which adds another
      layer of complexity. With <m>\CC</m>-valued functions, there is
      an operation called complex conjugation, which changes the sign
      of the imaginary piece of the function. It is written with a
      bar, so <m>\bar{\Psi}</m> is the conjugate. Then, expectation
      values in quantum mechanics are given by the following integral,
      where <m>D</m> is the domain of states and <m>f</m> is a
      observable on that domain of states.
    </p>
    <me>
      \langle f\rangle = \int_D \bar{\Psi} f \Psi dV
    </me>
    <p>
      All observables in quantum mechancs are calcualted from the wave
      function. Determining the behaviour of the wave function over
      time is the goal of the discpline; that behaviour is given by
      the famour Schrodinger equation. In this equation <m>V</m> is a
      potential energy function on the space of states, <m>\hbar</m>
      is a constant, <m>m</m> is the mass and <m>\imath</m> is the
      imaginary number, with <m>\imath^2 = -1</m>.
    </p>
    <me>
      \imath \hbar \frac{\del \Psi}{\del t} = \frac{-\hbar}{2m}
      \nabla^2 \Psi + V \Psi
    </me>
    <p>
      I'll assume that <m>\Psi(x,t)</m> has only one variable of
      position. (The following derivation works in three variables of
      position with roughly the same steps, but the notation becomes
      much more challenging). The expectation value for position is
      <m>\langle x\rangle</m>. What is momentum? It should be (up to
      a mass term) the rate of change of position. But the only
      available sense of position is the expectation value.
      Therefore, I should try to calculate <m>\frac{\del \langle
      x\rangle}{\del t}</m>. I use the compatibility of integration
      and differentiation to exchange the operations. (There are
      theorems, which I've omitted in this course, which allow this
      exchange).

      I need to calculate this derivative term. I make use of the

      The study of quantum mechanics thus becomes the study of
      operators on wave functions. This is a mathematically intense
      study, leading to whole new branches of mathematics focused on
      operator algebra. One of the first and most important question
      concerning operator is this: given two operators, do they
      commute? That is, if <m>F</m> and <m>G</m> are operators, is
      <m>F(G\Psi) = G(F\Psi)</m>?

      I use the commutator bracket to study the commutativity of
      operators. In studying operator algebra and continuous
      probability, I can derive the following inequality. (I don't
      have the time or machinery for the proof, unfortunately).

      This makes some sense: this operator is simply multiplication by
      a constant; it doesn't change the wave functions at all. It's
      expectation is simply itself <mdash/> it is a constant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I apply the <xref ref="theorem-commutator" /> to get the
      next result, where <m>x</m> stands for position and <m>p</m> for

    </p>
    <me>
      \sigma_x \sigma_p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}

    <p>
      What does this mean? The <m>\sigma</m> is the standard
      deviation: it measures how wide the probability is for each of
      the measurements. This can be thought of as error. If a
      <m>\sigma</m> is very small, we have a very precise observable.
      If <m>\sigma</m> is large, the possible values in a reasonable
      probabity are much larger. The product of these two
      <m>\sigma</m> is the product of the uncertain in the measurement
      of position and moment. This is the famous uncertainty
      princple. Because the operators do not commute, I can't
      measure them both precisely at the same time. That fact comes
      directly the the operator mathematics; this makes it intrinsic
      to this quantum mechanical model. The uncertainly is not a
      problem of measurement, but a mathematical fact of the systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be thought of in terms of particple/wave duality. A
      particle, as a probability distribution, is just a single peak.
      A wave, as a probability distribution, has a sinusoidal graph.
      Momentum is essentially wavelength in this interpretation. A
      particple has a definite position: the single peak is located
      somewhere. However, with no repetition, it has no wavelength.
      A wave has a wavelength, but since the graph extends outward, it
      has no fixed position. The uncertainly principle reflects how
      elementary objects have both wave and particple like behaviour,
      one to the exclusion of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      This commutator analysis works for all operators. Two operators
      are compatible observables if they commute. If they do not, a
      version of the uncertainly princples holds for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This leads to some of the standard philosophical problems of
      measurement in Quantum Mechanics. What does a measurement do?
      Why does it collapse a wave function? Is it human observation?
      Machine observation? Consciousness?
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, there were three main camps. The Realist camp
      claimed that things existed in reality and that probability is
      an illusion and weakness of the model. The Orthodox camp said
      that nothing exists before a measurement. The system
      <em>is</em> a probability<ndash/>nothing more or less. The
      Agnostic camp said that before measurement, any such question is
      meaningless, since measurement is all we have to interact with
      the universe. Many feel that none of the three answers are
