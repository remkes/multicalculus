    <title>Definition of Polar Coordinates</title>
    <p>
      I have already introduce the polar coordinate transformation in
      <xref ref="example-polar-coordinates-jacobian" />. In this
      section, I want to further investigate this transformation and do
      a number of examples with it. 
   </p>
   <p>
      First, though, I'll start with some motivation. Polar coordinates
      (and the other two important coordinate systems in <xref
      ref="section-cylindrical-and-spherical" />) are useful because 
      they describe circles and, therefore, anything with circular
      construction or symmetry of any type. Circles are common and
      natural shapes and many applications of mathematics deal with
      circls, circular motion, object with circular symmetry, etc. When
      a situation has some kind of symmetry to it, it's often best to
      choose a coordinate system that suits the symmetry. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be demontrated by talking about motion that is confined
      to circles. Say there is an object in <m>\RR^2</m> that is
      restricted to a circe of a particular radius <m>R</m>. It lives on
      the locus which is that circle. Applications will often want a
      description of this locus, to solve problems of movement,
      intersection, force, etc. To describe the circle in normal
      cartesian coordinates, I use the equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = R^2</m>.
      This isn't a terrible description, but it's also not the easier
      description; we may need square roots to solve for individual
      variables when we use this locus, for example. However, in polar
      coordinates, the locus of the circle is just <m>r=R</m>. This is
      as simple as it gets. The coordinate system suits the task. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me recap the details of the polar coordinate system, though
      they should be familiar from previous courses. In polar
      coordinates, a point in <m>\RR^2</m> is described by a radius
      <m>r</m> (which is the distant from the point to the origin) and
      an angle <m>\theta</m> (which is the angle between the
      <m>x</m>-axis and the line from the origin to the point, measure
      counterclockwise). This is show in <xref
      ref="figure-polar-coordinates" />.

      cartesian to polar coordinates).

    <title>Properties of Polar Coordinates</title>
    <p>
      I want to start with one notable weakness of polar coordinates.
      Unlike cartesian coordinates, which are defined and work well
      everywhere in <m>\RR^2</m>, polar coordaintes are not defined at
      the origin. The radius. <m>r=0</m>, is fine, but how would
      angle be defined at the origin? There is no arc to measure here,
      no line from the origin to a point to determine an angle. Angle
      simply can't be determined. This fact breaks the coordinate
      system at the origin. This isn't too much of a problem, but it
      is something that I always need to keep in mind when using polar
      coordinates. 
    </p>
    <p>
      One way to understand a coordinate system is to understand the
      paths in <m>\RR^2</m> where one of the coordinates is constant.
      In cartesian coordinates, this gives the horizontal lines
      <m>y=c</m> and the vertical lines <m>x=c</m> for the
      conventional square grid pattern of coordinate lines. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For polar coordinates, the loci <m>r = c</m> are circle, as I
      remarked earlier. The loci <m>\theta = c</m> are rays out from
      the original. This gives a spider-web pattern of coordinate
      lines, as shown in <xref ref="figure-polar-coordinates-lines"
      />. When I think of polar coordinates visually, this spider-web
      pattern is what I see.

    <p>
      I want to make on final comments about the <m>r</m> Jacobian for
      polar coordinates. In cartesian coordinates, both <m>x</m> and
      <m>y</m> have unit of length. Therefore, the differential <m>dx
      dy</m> has units of (infinitesimal) area, as it should for
      integration. (Recall we wrote this as <m>dA</m> when we were
      working in general, without specific coordinates). However, in
      polar coordinates, <m>r</m> has units of distance, but
      <m>\theta</m> has no units. (Radian angles can naturally be
      define as ratio of distances; the units cancel in the fraction
      and an angle has no natural unit.). Therefore, the differential
      <m>dr d\theta</m> has units only of distance. This doesn't make
      sense for integration, since this should be an infinitesimal
      area. The term with the Jacobian determinant is <m>r dr
      d\theta</m>; the additional <m>r</m> gives this units of area.

      Common Regions of Integration in Polar Coordinates
    </title>
    <p>
      I said ealier that polar coordinates are good for situations
      with some kind of circular symmetry or description. I want to
      go over some of these regions. First, I can integrate over a
      circle, obviously. To integrate over a circle of radius
      <m>R</m>, the bounds are <m>r \in [0,R]</m> and <m>\theta \in
      [0,2\pi]</m>.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_0^R \int_0^{2\pi} f(r,\theta) r dr d \theta.
    </me>
    <p>
      I can integrate over various subsets of circles. A wedge is a
      portion of a circle like a pizza slice. The radius is not limit,
      but the angle is. The bounds are <m>r \in [0,R]</m> and <m>\theta \in
      [\theta_1, \theta]</m>, for some range of angles. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_0^R \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} f(r,\theta) r dr d \theta.
    </me>
    <p>
      A region formed of a larger circle with a smaller circle (with
      the same centre) removed is called an annulus. In an annulus,
      the angle is unchanges, but the radius has limit. The region
      doesn't start at <m>r=0</m>, but rather starts as the inner
      radius <m>r = R_1</m> and ends at a larger radius <m>r =
      R_2</m>, with <m>R_1 \lt R_2</m>.  The bounds are <m>r \in
      [R_1,R_2]</m> and <m>\theta \in [0,2\pi]</m>.
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{R_1}^{R_2} \int_0^{2\pi} f(r,\theta) r dr d \theta.
    </me>
    <p>
      Finally, I could have a wedge-section of an annulus if I
      restrict both the radius and the angle. I might call this an
      arc. The bounds for this arc <m>r \in [R_1,R_2]</m> and
      <m>\theta \in [\theta_1,\theta_2]</m>.

      In many of these examples, particular when the bound become
      constant in polar constants, are seperable integrals. (Recall

          To show how some of these techniques work together, consider
          integrating the function <m>f(x,y) = x^2</m> over the ellipse
          <m>D = \frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1</m>.

        <p>
          I'm  going to do two changes of variables. First, I make the
          change of variables give by <m>x=2u</m> and <m>y=3v</m>.
          This change of variables has Jacobian <m>|J| = 6</m>
          so that <m>dx dy = 6 du dv</m>. The ellipse <m>D</m> becomes
          the unit circle <m>C</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_C (2u)^2 6 du dv = 24 \int_C u^2 du dv
        </me>
        <p>
          Now, since I am integrating over the unit circle, I can
          change to polar coordinates.

          Say I wanted to integrate the function <m>x^2 + y^2</m> over
          the circle of radius 1 centered at <m>(1,0)</m>. The
          integrand obviously lends itself to polar coordinates. There
          is circular symmetry in the domain, but the offset is a
          little confusing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The equation of this circle is <m>(x-1)^2 + y^2 = 1</m>. I
          can make this a polar locus by replacing <m>x</m> and
          <m>y</m> with their polar equivalent. Doing so produces
          <m>r^2 \cos^2 \theta - 2 r \cos \theta + 1 + r^2 \sin^2
          \theta =1</m>, which simplifies into <m>r^2 - 2r \cos \theta
          = 0</m> or <m>r = 2 \cos \theta</m> for <m>\theta \in \left[
          -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right]</m>. I can actually
          describe this in terms of polar coordinates; I just have to
          allow one of the bounds to be variable (like I did with
          variable bounds for cartesian coordinates). I will let the
          bound for <m>\theta</m> be constant, so that <m>\theta</m>
          will be the outside variable. Then I can use the expression
          <m>r = 2 \cos \theta</m> as an higher bound for <m>r</m> in
          terms of <m>\theta</m>. The lower bound for <m>r</m> will
          stil be <m>0</m>. <xref ref="figure-offset-circle" /> shows, in
          the straight lines, the range of the radius from <m>0</m> to
          <m>2 \cos \theta</m> as <m>\theta</m> ranges from
          <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m> to <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
