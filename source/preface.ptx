    Calculus III was primarily devoted to extending the derivative to
    multivariable scalar functions. This course starts with the
    parallel program of extending the integral to multivariable scalar
    functions. Unlike the derivative, the definition of the
    multivariable (definite) integral is relativley similar to the
    single variable case. The challenge of integration is in the
    geometry of the subsets of <m>\RR^n</m> involved in the
    integration. The course proceeds to a number of applications of
    multivariable integration.

    The second half of the course covers the material known as cector
    calculus. This is the calculus of multivariable vector functions:
    functions with multivariable outputs as well as inputs. We
    investigate several derivative and integral extensions for these
    functions.

    Since the extension of the derivative to multivariable functions
    is multi-faceted, we loose the simple idea of an antiderivative.
    However, in the context of vector calculus, we can produce several
    new theorems which resemble the fundamental theorem of calculus,
    even without a simple anti-derivative. The fruit of this labour
    are the famous Gauss, Green and Stokes theorems.

    The final section of the course is a brief introduction to
    differential geometry. We introduce the ideas of manifolds and
    differential forms (and we finally get a reasonable definition of
    the differential <sq>dx</sq> used in integrals). We develop this
    material far enough to show the deep connections underlying the
    fundamental theorem of calculus and the Gauss, Green and Stokes
    theorems.
