          Write the equation of the plane with normal <m>(-1,-1,0)</m>

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The normal determines the coefficients of the equation of
          the plane. I put those coefficients into the general form,
          with the constant <m>d</m> undetermined.
          <me>
            (-1)x + (-1)y + 0 z = d 
          </me>
          I can calculate the constant using the point. Put the
          coordinates of the point into the left side of the equation
          and calculate <m>d</m>.
          <me>
            d = (-1)(0) + (-1)(1) + (0)(3) = -1 
          </me>
          Therefore, the equation of the plane is 
          <me>
            - x - y = -1

          Write the equation of the plane with normal

          The normal determines the coefficients of the equation of

            2x + 0y + 3z = d

          I can calculate the constant using the point. Put the

            d = 2(-4) + 0(-1) + 3(2) = -2

      </statement>

          The cross product of the local directions gives the normal

            -1)
          </me>
          This is the normal. The normal determines the coefficients
          of the equation of the plane. I put those coefficients into
          the general form, with the constant <m>d</m> undetermined.
          <me>
            -x - 2y - z = d

            d = -(1)(2) - (2)(1) - (1) = -5

            d = 0(-1) - 2(0) + 2(-3) = -6

          The local directions are given by the differences of the

          I can calculate the constant using the point (I can use

            d = (0)(0) + 2 (1) - 2(1) = 0
