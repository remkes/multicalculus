    <title>Fields and Surfaces</title>
    <p>
      Given a vector field and a parametric curve, the line integral
      measured the interaction of the field and the curve. It told how
      much the field helped or hindered movement along the curve. This
      was measured by a dot product of the field with the tangent to
      the curve, since the dot product nicely measures the interaction
      of two vector. Now, instead of asking for the action of a field
      along a curve, I'm interesting in the action of a field through
      a surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest difference here is that a surface doesn't have the
      notion of movement. Instead, the surface is treated as a static
      object; I'm interesting in how the field moves through the
      surface. That said, parametrization still matters. A parametric
      surface has a normal calculated in the two parameters. Again, I
      look to the dot product. The dot product of the vector field
      with the normal to the surface shows the interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the field and the normal point roughly in the same direction,
      then the field is passing through the surfaces, transversely, at
      that point. This is a strong positive reaction. If the field and
      normal have nearly opposite direction, then there is a strong
      negative reaction. The parametrization and the normal gives an
      orientation to the surface: there is a differnce (in sign)
      between moving through the surface with the normal or against
      the normal. I can think of this of choosing sides of the
      surface: say, moving from below to above is positive and moving
      from above to below is negative. Unlike a locus, a parametric
      surface has this orientation, this choice of above and below,
      intrinsically built into the definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the vector field and the normal to the surface are nearly
      perpendicualr, then the field mostly flows along the surface,
      tangentially. This is measured by a small dot prodcut. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The unit tangent was useful in the definition of the line
      integral. I'm going to need the equivalent definition here of
      the unit normal. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\sigma(u,v)</m> be a parametric surface in
          <m>\RR^3</m> defined over a simply-connected domain
          <m>D</m>. The <term>unit normal</term> <m>N</m> of the
          surface is the vector <m>\frac{\sigma_u \times
          \sigma_v}{|\sigma_u \times \sigma_v|}</m>. (Note that in the
          definition of a parmetric surface, the normal can never be
          zero. Division by zero is avoided by this stipulation.)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      For parametric curves, the parametrization by arclength is a
      unique parametrization that can be assigned to any particular
      curve shape. It has the property that its tangent is aways the
      unit tangent. I can also define a special parametrization of a
      surface, <m>\sigma(s,t)</m>, where the <m>\sigma_s(s,t) \times
      \sigma_t(s,t) = N</m>. This is the unique parametrization where
      the normal is always the unit normal. Just like I used the
      parametrization by arclength to define line integrals, I use
      this special parametrization to defined integrals over
      parametric surfacees. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\sigma(s,t)</m> be a parametric surface in <m>\RR^3</m>
          defined over a simply-connected domain <m>D</m>. Assume the
          parametrization in parameters <m>(s,t)</m> is the unique
          parametrization where <m>\sigma_s \times \sigma_t = N</m>.
          Let <m>F</m> be a vector field defined on a neighbourhood of
          the surface.  (A neighbourhood is any open set which
          contains the entire surface.) The <term>flux integral</term>
          is defined to be the following integral.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_{\sigma} F \cdot N dA = \int_{\sigma} F \cdot dA =
          \int_D F(\sigma(s,t)) \cdot N(s,t) ds dt 
        </me>
        <p>
          The first notation is more complete, but the second notation
          is conventional.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      As with curves, I don't want to calculate with the special
      parametrizations, since it may be very difficult to actually
      produce that parametrization.  I'd rather calculate with an
      arbitrary parametrization. In an arbitrary parametrization, <m>dA =
      |\sigma_u \times \sigma_v| du dv</m>. I can perform a change of
      variables on the integral in the definition.
    </p>
    <md>
      <mrow>
        \int_{\sigma} F \cdot N dA \amp = \int_D F(\sigma(u,v)) \cdot
        \frac{\sigma_u \times \sigma_v}{|\sigma_u \times \sigma_v|}
        |\sigma_u \times \sigma_v| du dv
      </mrow>
      <mrow>
        \amp = \int_D F(\sigma(u,v)) \cdot (\sigma_u \times \sigma_v)
        du dv
      </mrow>
    </md>
    <p>
      The result of the change of variables is a flux integral
      calcuted in any arbitrary parametrization. The length of the
      norml has conveniently cancelled off (like the length of the
      tangent cancelled off in the definition of a line integral.) The
      result is a very reasonable way to calcualte flux integrals in
      any arbitrary parametrizations with the knowledge that the
      integral doesn't depend on the parametrizations.

          <m>F(x,y,z) = (0,0,k)</m> is a constant vertical flow with the
          same flow rate. I can imagine this flow through a 
          vertical pipe with radius <m>a</m> around the <m>z</m> axis by
          restricting the field to the domain where <m>x^2 + y^2 \leq
          a</m>. At some point in the pipe (say <m>z=0</m>), I can ask
          how much fluid is flowing through the pipe. The cross
          section of the pipe is a circle of radius <m>a</m> at height
          <m>z=0</m>. I can parametrize this circle as

          for <m>(r,\theta) \in [0,a] \times [0,2\pi]</m>. Then I can
          calculate the flux integral to determine how much water is
          flowing through the pipe at this point.

          This answer is unsurpring. <m>\pi a^2</m> is the
          cross-sectional area and <m>k</m> is the
          rate of flow. The rate of flow is constant everywhere, so it
          makes sense that the result of the integral is just the
          product of this cross sectional area <m>\pi a^2</m> and the
          flow rate <m>k</m>.

          Let me introduce a small variation of the previous example.
          I'll stick with the same pipe, but change the field so that
          the flow through the pipe is not uniform. Consider this
          field.

        <p>
          In the very middle of the pipe, this flow has the same flow
          rate <m>k</m> as the previous example. However, the flow
          gets slower closer to the edge of the pipe, becoming no flow
          at all at the edge itself. I'll calculate the flux integral
          to measure the total flow of this new field through a
          cross-section of the pipe.

          This is half the original flux. The lower rate of flow makes
          sense; near the centre, the flow was similar to the previous
          example, but near the edge, the flow is much slower. The
          flux integral should produce a smaller result.

          Still sticking with this pipe and measuring the flux through
          a cross-sectional circle, I'll complicate the field yet
          more. The following is a turbulent flow, where other
          directions are introduced as the flow may includes vortices.

          Consider a paddle with a roughly rectangular cross section
          15cm wide and 30cm tall. Say it moves through the water in
          the <m>z</m> direction with speed <m>v</m>. I can 
          reinterpret the situation by letting the water move with field
          <m>F = (0,0,v)</m> in which the paddle is stationary. I can
          think of the force the paddle causes in terms of the flux of
          this field through the paddle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I can perform a paddle stroke directly perpendicular to
          the direction of movement or at an angle <m>\theta</m>. My 
          question is: how does our forward force (hence flux) vary due
          to <m>\theta</m>?
        </p>
        <p>
          If the paddle is angled at angle <m>\theta</m>, then it is
          represented as a surface with normal <m>(\sin \theta, 0, \cos
          \theta)</m>. Therefore <m>F \cdot N = v \cos \theta</m>. (I
          can make this calculation without even have to do all the
          formal details of parametrization, since only the normal is
          important. The paddle is a part of a plane, so it has a
          constant normal.) Then I calculate the flux integral. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_\sigma F \cdot N dA = \int_D V \cos \theta dA = v \cos
          \theta \int_D 1 dA = 450 v \cos \theta
        </me>
        <p>
         Compared to the perpendicular force or <m>450v</m>
         the force due to a paddle stroke at an angle is this original
         force multiplied by <m>\cos \theta</m>. Cosine is the
         approprate result here: when there is no adjustment to the
         angle (<m>\theta = 0</m>), cosine is <m>1</m> and the full
         force is applied; when the paddle turned a full quarter turn,
         cosine is <m>0</m> and there is no force at all.
