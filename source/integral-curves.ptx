    <title>Vector Fields and Parametric Curve</title>    
    <p>
      I said in the previous section that fields of force and fluid
      flows would be my primary motivating examples. Let me start by
      talking about these two fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I have a field of force, it acts on objects in it.
      (Gravitation force acts on object with mass, electromagnetic
      force acts on object with charge). A natural question is: if I
      put an object in a field, what will it do? How will the force
      act upon it? Presumably, the object will move due to the force.
      How will it move? What path will it take?
    </p>
    <p>
      I can ask a similar question about a fluid flow. If I put a
      bouyant object (not affected by other forces such as gravity) in
      a fluid, what will happen to it? Presumably, it will move with
      the movement of the fluid. What path will it take?
    </p>
    <p>
      In both of these contexts, I ended up asking about a path. A
      path is a parametric curve. So, so answer this question, there
      should be a connection between vector field and parametric
      curves. Let me define this connection.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F: S \rightarrow \RR^n</m> be a vector field on a
          region <m>S \subset \RR^n</m>. A parametric curve <m>\gamma:
          [a,b] \rightarrow S </m> is called a <term>integral
          curves</term> of the vector field if, at all points on
          the curve, <m>\gamma^\prime(t) = F(\gamma(t))</m>.
          That is, the <term>tangents</term> of the parametric curves
          are the same as the vector field along the whole curve.
        </p>
      </statement>
   </definition>
   <p>
    The parametric curves are the paths I wanted for my application.
    If an boyant object starts <em>at rest</em> in a fluid, or a
    charged object starts in an area with
    electromagnetic force, the integral curve going through the
    starting point will be the path the object will move along. (This
    is not entirely true, I admit: there is a subtlety about the
    starting velocity of the object and how that interacts with the
    curve, but I'll leave that aside for now.)

          Consider the vector field <m>F(x,y) = (-y,x)</m>, as shown in
          <xref ref="figure-vector-field3" />, with its
          integral curves in <xref ref="figure-vector-field3-curves"
          />. These integral curves of <m>F(x,y) =
          (-y,x)</m> aren't surprising. Looking just at the vector
          fields, I can clearly tell that the fluid is travelling in a
          circular paths. Mathematically, the circles are curves
          <m>\gamma(t) = (a \cos t, a \sin t)</m> for a parameter <m>a >
          0</m>. I can calculate <m>\gamma^\prime(t) = (-a\sin t, a
          \cos t)</m>. Now, I can notice that the first component of
          the derivative, <m>-a \sin t</m>, is the negative of the
          <m>y</m> component of the curve. Likewise, the second
          component of the derivative is exactly the first component
          of the curve. Therefore, I can write <m>\gamma^(t) =
          (-y,x)</m>, where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are the component of
          the curve. In this way, the derivative of the curve
          (expressed in the original component of the curve) and the
          vector field have the same expression. The tangents to the
          curve are the vectors in the vector field.

    <title>Calculating Integral Curves</title>
    <p>
      Integral curves are a very powerful conceptual tool. However,
      they are usually very hard to calculate and most examples are
      beyond the scope of this course. However, there will be a few I
      can attempt. I'll describe the general process in <m>\RR^3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <m>F = (F_1,F_2,F_3)</m> is a vector field and <m>\gamma(t) =
      (\gamma_1, \gamma_2,\gamma_3)</m> is a parametric curve, then
      <m>\gamma</m> is an integral curve if it satisfies the following
      system.

      This is a system (generally non-linear) of three differential
      equations in three functions, the <m>\gamma_i</m>. Even if it is
      linear, this is still a difficult system to solve, if not
      impossible. Even a simple field such as <m>F(x,y,z) = (y,z,x)</m>
      leads to a difficult system.

      Currently, I have no method for approaching this system. (For
      those who have taken the differential equations course, you may
      recognize that this is a linear system and that course did cover
      solving linear systems of differential equation). However, there
      are some examples with reasonable systems of equations which I
      will be able to solve with integration.

          Each differential equation can be solved directly. These are
          seperable differential equation, but I can also simply
          notice that these are the basic exponential equation.
          Therefore, the solutions must be exponential function. Each
          exponential function will have an unknown starting value.
          Here are the solutions.

          This system can be solved by iteration. I can solve the
          first equation by integration. Then the second equation
          relies on the first component, so I can use the first
          solution to solve the second by integration again. Finally,
          the third relies on the second, so I can use the second
          function and integration to calculate the third.
