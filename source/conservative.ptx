  <title>Conservative Vector Fields</title>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="section-vector-fields" />, I talked about two
    motivating examples: fluid flows and fields of force. In this
    section, I'll focus particularly on fields of force. I'm
    interested in describing force (per unit mass) of gravitational
    attration due to a massive particle and force (per unit charge) of
    electronmatic attraction or repulsion due to a charged particle.
    I'm going to dip briefly into some physics to motivate the
    definitions of this section.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many ways to describe the force or gravity or the
    electromagnetic force. One of them is to describe changes in
    potential energy. Potential energy is a <em>scalar</em> that
    describes the state of an object with relation to another
    electromagnetic or massive object. State in terms of potential
    energy, force is understood at the tendency for object to minimize
    their potential energy as quickly as possible. That is, an object
    will move in the direction of greatest decrease. Thankfully, we
    already have a tool to describe the direction of greatest
    increase/decrease for a scalar field: the gradient. So, the fields
    of force I want to discuss are fields of force that can be
    described as gradients of some potential energy. There is a name
    for these vector fields.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m> be a scalar field. Then field <m>\nabla f</m>
        created from a potential energy field is called a
        <term>conservative vector field</term>. If <m>F</m> is a
        vector field with <m>F = \nabla f</m> then <m>f</m> is a
        <term>scalar potential</term> for <m>F</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Given a general vector field <m>F</m>, I would like to
    check whether or not it is conservative. From <xref
    ref="proposition-composition-nabla" />, for any scalar field
    <m>f</m>, <m>\nabla \times \nabla f=0</m>. Therefore, all
    conservative fields are irrotation. Is the converse true? If it
    were, then checking the curl would be a very convenient way to
    find conservative vector fields. It turns out that the converse is
    often true, but I need to define a technical definition to
    describe the conditions when this work. 
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>U</m> be an open subset of <m>\RR^n</m>. <m>U</m> is
        called <term>path connected</term> if there is a parametric
        curve connecting any two points <m>a, b \in U</m>. (Recall in
        the definition in Calculus III that parametric curves are
        always continuous.) A parametric curve is falled
        <term>closed</term> if its start and end poitns are the same. If
        <m>U</m> is path connected, it is also called <term>simply
        connected</term> if any closed path can be contracted
        down to a point. (Think of the path as a loop in a rope, and
        contraction as pulling the rope so that the loop disappears.
        This needs to happen in such a way that all the intermediate
        steps are still paths in the set <m>U</m>).
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Naively, a simply connected set has no holes in it. A solid
    cylinder is simply connected. However, the hollow cylinder is
    not, since a loop around the cylinder can never be contracted. A
    disc is simply connected; a ring is not. Now I can state the test
    for conservative vector fields.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>U</m> be a simply connected open set in <m>\RR^3</m>
        and let <m>F: U \rightarrow \RR^3</m> be a differentiable
        vector field. Then <m>F</m> is conservative on <m>U</m> if an
        only if <m>\nabla \times F = 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <p>
    If <m>F</m> is conservative, then there exists at least one (in
    fact, infinitely many!) scalar potential <m>f</m> with <m>F = \nabla
    f</m>. Given a conservative vector fields, I'd like to be able to
    calculate this scalar potent. How is it done? I'll start by
    expanding the equation <m>F = \nabla f</m> in its components. I'll
    work just in <m>\RR^3</m>, though potentials can happy in any
    dimension.

  </md>
  <p>
    I can integrate each of these equations. However, I have to be
    careful with the <sq>constants</sq>: in each integral, since all
    varaible other than the variable of integration are being treated
    as constant, the constants of integration can be functions of both
    of the remaining variables.

    Finding <m>f</m> amounts to finding a scalar field that fits this
    system. For reasonable <m>F</m>, this isn't too terrible. Often,
    the information from the other equations will help determine the
    functions <m>g_i</m>. Since there is all this choice, however, it
    is reasonable to wonder how many scalar potentials a conservative
    vector field actually has.
  </p>
  <proposition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>F</m> be a conservative vector field on a connected set
        (not necessarily simply connected). Then the scalar potential
        of <m>F</m> is unique up to a constant. That is, if <m>f</m>
        is a scalar potential, then any other scalar potential for
        <m>F</m> has the form <m>f + c</m> for <m>c \in \RR</m>.

    This situation is pretty good; from all the possibility
    variability in the system of differential equations, the
    difference in potential basically comes down to a constant (an
    actual, real constant!) of integration. Let me do a couple
    exmaples. 
  </p>

    <statement>

        is defined on <m>\RR^3</m>, which is simply connected.

          \cos (xy) - \frac{\del}{\del x} 2z, \right.

        <mrow>

    Returning to the physics that motivated this whole
    section: what does this constant of integration mean? If a force
    is described by potential energey, then why does potential energy
    have an unknown or arbitrary constant? 
  </p>
  <p>
    The constant of integration reflects the fact that energy levels
    are arbitrarily set. Energy is relative to some arbitrary set base
    level. On the surface of the earth, you can set potential energy
    to be zero when something is on the ground, so that it can gain
    potential energey as it moves up. In planetary systems with the
    gravitional source at the origin, the convention is to set
    potential energy to <m>-\infty</m> (in the limit) at the origin,
    increasing to <m>0</m> as the distance from the origin goes to
    <m>\infty</m>. These are convenient conventions for the
    calculations physicists want to do with energy, but they are just
    convention.
  </p>
  <p>
    This leads me to an interesting and important point: energy is a
    fiction. In the mathematical models of Newtonian physics (leaving
    the subtleties of relativity and quantumn mechanics aside for
    now), things like mass, charge, distance and time are real, fixed
    quantities. They mean something about the physical universe.
    Energy is not like these. Energy is fiction we made up and set to
    an arbitrary reference level, because it leads to very nice
    explanations of movement (i.e. objects accelerate to minimize
    their potential energy). Whether energy is positive or negative,
    large or small in magnitude, doesn't matter to the system. There
    is no intrinsic energy. What is real is difference in energey, how
    much potential energy changes with position, how much kinetic
    energey changes with velocity (relatively, of course, to some
    fixed reference frame).
  </p>
  <p>
    In the initial discussion on potential energy, you may have
    noticed some small confusion about increase and decrease. Gradient
    points in the direction of greatest increase. However, in the
    interpretations of phyics for forces, objects move in the
    direction of greatest decrease. There is a sign issue here. The
    terminology in this section is correct: if <m>F</m> is a
    conservative with with <m>F = \nabla f</m>, then <m>f</m> is its
    scalar potential. However, for the actual conservative forces in
    physics (gravitational and electromagnetic), to account for this
    sign difference, the force will be the negative gradient: <m>F =
    -\nabla f</m>
  </p>
  <p>
    Let me end with one final observation about the interpretation of
    conservative forces and their potential energy scalar fields. If
    <m>-f</m> is the (sign-corrected) scalar potential for <m>F</m>,
    then <m>F</m> points in the direction of greatest decrease of
    <m>f</m>. The integral curves of <m>F</m> are parametric curves
    whose tangents are all these direction of greatest decrease. 
    They are the direction of movement of an object starting at rest
    under the action of the force. In this sense, a potential energy
    <m>f</m> cause movement (on object starting at rest) along the
    integral curves of its gradient.
