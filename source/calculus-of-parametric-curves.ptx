      REWORK THIS SECTION TO TIE TOGETHER TANGENTS AND LENGTHS 
      Parametric curves are vector-valued functions, so they have
      derivatives as defined earlier. Since parametric curves are
      interpreted as  motion through <m>\RR^n</m>, the derivative has
      a related interpretation.

          Let <m>\gamma(t): [a,b] \rightarrow \RR^n</m> be a
          parametric curve. Its derivative <m>\gamma^\prime(t)</m> is
          called the <term>tangent vector</term> to the parametric
          curve.

      This tangent is no longer the slope of a tangent line from
      single-variable claculus. It is a vector; specifically, 
      local direction vector along the curve. At <m>\gamma(a)</m>,
      <m>\gamma^\prime(a)</m> points in the local direction of
      movement. The notion of a derivative as a tangent direction
      replaces old notion of the derivative as the slope of the
      tangent line.

          All of these tangent vectors are multiples of the vector
          <m>(1,2)</m>, but they have different lengths, as seen in
          <xref ref="figure-tangent-lengths" />.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The tangent vector indicates the instantaneous direction
      of motion. The tangent vector also has a length, independent of
      the direction. The length of the tangent vector measures the
      speed of the curve going through that point. If the movement
      along the curve is very fast, the tangent vector will have a
      large length; if the movement along the curve is slow, the
      tangent vector will be shorter.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the parametrizations of the graph of the parabola in <xref
      ref="figure-tangent-lengths" />, I can see this behaviour
      clearly: the direction of the tangent is independent of the
      parametrization, but the length of the tangent is entirely
      dependent on the parametrization. The parametrizations which
      move more quickly along the curve have longer tangents.

      Often it is useful to only consider the tangent direction.

          the unique vector of length one in the same direction as
          <m>\gamma^\prime(t)</m>. It is often written <m>T(t)</m>.
          To calculate the unit tangent, I simply take the tangent
          vector and divide by its length.

      My goal in this section is to produce a formula describing the
      length of a parametric curve. I approximate this length by
      breaking up a curve <m>\gamma</m> into a series of straight
      lines. In order to visualize the process, I work in
      <m>\RR^2</m> for the moment, as in <xref
      ref="figure-arclength-approximation" />. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For each straight line segment, the length of the segment is
      given by using pythagorus on the triange formed by the segment
      and the changes in each variable. I know <m>\Delta y</m> and
      <m>\Delta x</m>, then the length of the segment is
      <m>\sqrt{\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2}</m>. I approximate the total
      length of the curve by adding up the lengths of these segments.
      <me>
        L \cong \sum \sqrt{\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      If I take the limit of this process, breaking the curve into
      smaller and smaller pieces, I produce a Riemann sum which
      defines a definite integral. In the limit, the <m>\Delta</m>
      terms become the infinitesimals <m>dy</m> and <m>dx</m>.
      <me>
        L = \int_a^b \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> depend on <m>t</m>, so I can change
      this to a integral in <m>t</m>. (This is is poor notation, I
      admit, confusiong fractions and derivatives. The deeper
      situation here is a chain rule replacement, but I don't want to
      belabour the technical details.)

      The symmetric argument in <xref ref="example-asteroid" />
      deserves some attention. In parametric curves, this kind of
      symmetry argument can be very valuable. It's often easier to
      work with a small section of a curve, particularly for
      integration. If I can argue that the whole curve is just a
      repetition of a small portion (perhaps reflected or rotated),
      then I can reasonable use the small portion to calculate
      information about the whole curve.

          The letter <m>s</m> is conventional notation for the
          arclength function.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The arclength function measures the length of the curve as a
      function of the parameter; it is simply the distance travelled
      along the curve. For example, if <m>t \in [0,10]</m>, then
      <m>s(3)</m> is the distance along the curve from
      <m>\gamma(0)</m> to <m>\gamma(3)</m>, <m>s(5)</m> is the
      distance the curve has covered from <m>\gamma(0)</m> to
      <m>\gamma(5)</m>, <m>s(8)</m> is the distance along the curve
      from <m>\gamma(0)</m> to <m>\gamma(8)</m> and so on. Since
      <m>s</m> depends on <m>t</m> outside the integral, I have to
      choose a temporary variable <m>u</m> inside the integral; in
      the integral, <m>t</m> is simply repalced with <m>u</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to use the arclength function to reparametrize curve.
      The process, therefore, has three steps.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            I calculate the arclength fuction <m>s(t)</m> by
            integration.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I invert the arclength function. Arclength is always an
            increasing function, so it is always invertible. I write
            the inverse as <m>t(s)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>

            reparametrize by replacing <m>t</m> with <m>t(s)</m>.

    <title>Arclength and Tangents</title>
    <p>
      There are some very natural connections between tangents and
      arclength which relate to the intepretation of parametric curves
      as movement through space. I'll return to the arc length
      formula (in <m>\RR^2</m>, for simplicity).
      <me>
        L = \int_a^b \sqrt{x^\prime(t)^2 + y^\prime(t)^2} dt
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The tangent vector is <m>\gamma^\prime(t) = (x^\prime(t),
      y^\prime(t))</m>, so this integrand in the arclength formula is
      nothing more than the length of the tangent vector. This lets
      me rewrite the arclength formula.
      <me>
        L = \int_a^b |\gamma^\prime(t)| dt
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This hopefully makes intuitive sense <mdash/> the length of the
      tangent vector measures the speed of the curve. To get length
      (the distance travelled), I integrate the speed of movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      An nice event occurs when I differentiate the arclength
      function <m>s(t)</m>. The fundamental theorem of calculus
      lets me differentiate an integral.
      <me>
        \frac{d}{dt} s(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \int_a^t |\gamma^\prime(u)|
        du = |\gamma^\prime (t)|
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The derivative of the arclength function is the length of the
      tangent vector, which represents the speed of movement along the
      curve. To get speed, I differentiate length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of these observations generalize the relationship between
      distance and speed from single variable calculus. In that
      setting, the relationship was relatively direct: if <m>d(t)</m>
      was distance, then <m>d^\prime(t)</m> was speed and if
      <m>v(t)</m> was speed then <m>\int v(t) dt</m> was distance.
      The idea here is exactly the same, but since the movement is
      much more complicated, going through multi-dimensional space, I
      need more complicated definitions and notations to access the
      idea.

      These properties are very useful and convenient. In the
      remainder of this chapter, I will make frequent use of the
      parametrization by arclength; it serves as the default
      parametrization. I can do this since the parametrization by
      arclength always exists and is unique. Having a special,
      default parameter allows me to make good definitions which will
      be independent of the choice of parametrization. (In practice,
      the parametrization by arclength can be extremely difficult to
      actually calculate. For theoretical results, however, this
      difficulty isn't relevant).
    </p>
    <p>
      The existence of multiple parametrization for parametric curves
      is an example of a very general trend in abstract mathematics. A
      mathematical structure is some kind of pattern or behaviour
      (such as a curve being a particular path through space). This
      pattern can be presented in a variety of ways (such as a variety
      of parametrizations). This always presents a fundamental
      difficulty: if you want to understand something about the
      general pattern -- about the mathematical structure in itself --
      you need to make sure that your observations transcend the
      particularities of the presentation. Sometimes, there is a
      special presentation (such as the parametrization by arclength)
      which serves as the ideal model of the structure. Where there is
      such a presentation, mathematicians make heavy use of it. Where
      no such presentation exists (which is usually the case),
      mathematicians always have to struggle with the tension between 
      pattern itself and how the pattern is presented.

    <title>Curvature</title>
    <p>
      The tangent vector for a parametric curve measures the speed and
      direction of movement along the curve. Speed and direction are
      good information, but not enough to completely describe motion in
      multiple dimensions. In particular, the tangent vector gives
      the direction but doesn't say how direction is changing. This
      section builds up the notions of curvature and torsion, which
      will complete a full description of the changing directions of
      movement. In this section, I exclusively work in <m>\RR^3</m>.
    </p>
    <p>

            Straight motion: the direction is fixed and only speed

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Curving motion in a plane: motion is fixed to a plane, but

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Twisting motion: the most general motion, where in
            addition to curving in a plane, a curve can also twist
            away from the plane.

      Throughout this section, let <m>\gamma(t): [a,b] \rightarrow
      \RR^3</m> be a curve in three dimensions.  To start with (and to
      ensure that the following definition does not depend on
      parametrization), I will assume the curve is parametrized by arc
      length: I will use the parameter <m>s</m> and write
      <m>\gamma(s)</m>. In this parametrization, the tangent is a unit
      vector, so <m>T(s) = \gamma^\prime(s)</m>.

        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma(s): [a,b] \rightarrow \RR^3</m> be a
          parametric curve parametrized by arclength. The
          <term>curvature</term> of <m>\gamma(s)</m> is a scalar
          <m>\kappa(s)</m> which measure how quickly the curve is
          turning.

            \kappa(s) = \left| \frac{dT(s)}{ds} \right|

      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      There are a couple things to note about this definition. First,
      <m>\kappa</m> is the greek letter kappa, even though it looks
      like the Englith <sq>k</sq>. Second, <m>T(s)</m> is a vector, so
      the derivative <m>\frac{dT(s)}{ds}</m> is a vector derivative
      <mdash/> the derivative is taken in each component of the
      vector. Curvature is the scalar length of the resulting vector.
      Finally, the unit tangent is the direction of motion. Therefore,
      the derivative of the unit tangent measure the change in
      direction. The length of this derivative is a scalar measure of
      how quickly direction is changing. (Note that thought <m>|T(s)|
      = 1</m>, there is no reason to expect that <m>|T^\prime(s)| =
      1</m>; the magnitude of the change in a unit vector can be any
      possible magnitude.) 
    </p>
    <p>
      The given definition of curvatuve only works for parametrization
      by arclength. I would like to calculate <m>\kappa</m> in terms

        parametrization. This composition also applies to the unit
        tangent: <m>T(s(t)</m>. Then to differentiate in <m>t</m>
        requires a chain rule.

        I can rearrange this equation and then take the lengths of
        the vectors.
        <me>
          \frac{dT}{ds} = \frac{\frac{dT}{dt}}{\frac{ds}{dt}} \implies
          \left| \frac{dT}{ds} \right| = \left|
          \frac{\frac{dT}{dt}}{\frac{ds}{dt}} \right| \implies \left|
          \frac{dT}{ds} \right| =

      <p>
        The left hand side of this expression is exactly
        <m>\kappa</m>, the curvature. The numerator on the right hand
        side can be written <m>|T^\prime(t)|</m>, the change in the
        unit tangent for an arbitrary parametrization. The
        denominator <m>\left| \frac{ds}{dt} \right|</m> is just the

          Again unsurprisingly, the unit circle has constant curvature
          of one; I would expect uniform curvate for a circle. This
          also give a reference for the scale of curvature: curvature
          of one is exactly the curvature of the unit circle.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A similar calcluation can be done for the circle of radius
          <m>a</m>, which is <m>\gamma(t) = (a \cos t, a \sin t)</m>.
          If I repeat all the steps for the unit circle, I can
          conclude that <m>\kappa(t) = \frac{1}{a}</m>. Again, this is
          constant, which makes sense since the circle is equally
          curved at all points. However, it's interesting to note that
          the curvature is <em>inversely</em> proportional to the
          radius.  A curvature value of <m>\kappa</m> is interpreted
          as the curvature of a circle of radius
          <m>\frac{1}{\kappa}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This hopefully makes sense <mdash/> a circle with a very
          large radius doesn't locally have to curve very much. I
          know this very well, living on the surface of the earth:
          since the radius of the earth is large, I don't really see
          the curvature of its surface. However, for circle with very
          small radius, there is less distance to cover a whole
          revolution, so the curvature must be larger.

    <proof>
      <p>
        There are several ways to argue this result. First, I can
        think about the geometry of the sphere and its tangents
        (though, I confess, this argument uses some ideas from future
        weeks in the course.) Since <m>\gamma(t)</m> is always a unit
        vector, the path of <m>\gamma(t)</m> is a path on the unit
        sphere in <m>\RR^3</m>.  The tangent direction of this path,
        therefore, must be a tangent to the unit sphere. Unit vector
        point directly out of the unit sphere; they are perpendicular
        to tangent vectors of the unit sphere. Therefore,
        <m>\gamma</m> and <m>\gamma^\prime</m> must be perpendicular
        vectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, I could argue more directly from the definition
        of a unit vector. If <m>\gamma(t)</m> is a unit vector, its
        length can never change -- the length is fixed at one. If
        <m>\gamma^\prime(t)</m> share any small direction with
        <m>\gamma(t)</m> (more formally, if the projection was
        non-zero), then there would be a portion of the tangent vector
        pointing in the direction of <m>\gamma(t)</m>. This would
        indicate that there is change in the direction of the vector.
        Such a change would necessarily change the length of the
        vector; increasing it is the growth is aligned with the
        vector, and decreasing it is the growth is against the vector.
        Therefore, <m>\gamma(t)</m> and <m>\gamma^\prime(t)</m> cannot
        share any such small direction.  The projection of the latter
        onto the former must be zero, which is equivalent to them
        being perpendicular.

      <xref ref="lemma-unit-vector-derivative">Lemma</xref> shows that

      I want to complete these definitions with interpretation. I've
      already spent some time on the unit tangent vector <m>T(t)</m>.
      It represents the direction of movement of the curve at that
      point. The associated scalar is speed, measuring how fast the
      object is moving at this point in the curve. The normal vector
      <m>N(t)</m> represents the direction of curvature. Curvature
      was a scalar, measuring how curved the curve is at this point.
      The normal vector adds to this scalar a direction, telling you
      which way the curve is turning. The two vectors <m>T</m> and
      <m>N</m> determine a plane.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The plane determined by <m>T</m> and <m>N</m>is called the

        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If a parametric curve isn't twisted, the osculating plane is the
      plane on which the curve travels. The binormal vector
      <m>B(t)</m> is perpendicular to the osculating plane. Since
      planes are best described by their normals, I use <m>B(t)</m>
      to keep track of the osculating plane.

      The third type of movement I want to describe is twisting
      movement, where a curve can twist away from its plane of movement.
      Since the osculating plane is determined by its normal
      <m>B(t)</m>, twisting motion involves the change in
      <m>B(t)</m>.

          Let <m>\gamma(s): [0,L] \rightarrow \RR^3</m> be a

      Torsion is a scalar that measures the change in <m>B</m>, the

      plane of motion.

      As with curvature, I want to calculate torsion in an arbitrary

    <proposition>

        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma(t): [a,b] \rightarrow \RR</m> be a parametric
          curve in an arbitrary parametrization. Then its torsion is
          calculabed by the formula
          <me>
            \tau(t) = \frac{-1}{|\gamma^\prime(t)|} B^\prime(t) \cdot
            N(t)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <proof>
      <p>
        As in the proof for torsion, I can setup an arbitrary
        parametrization using the arclength function 
        <m>s = s(t)</m>. Then I can write <m>B(s(t))</m> for the
        binormal in the arbitrary parametrization. The chain rule
        calculates the derivative of the binormal vector.
        <me>
          \frac{dB(t)}{dt} = \frac{dB(t(s))}{ds} \frac{ds}{dt}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        I can rearrange this expression.
        <me>
          \frac{dB(s)}{ds} = \frac{\frac{dB(t)}{dt}}{\frac{dt}{ds}} =
          \frac{B^\prime(t)}{|\gamma^\prime(t)|}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Omiting the proof here, it is true that <m>B^\prime(t)</m>
        points in the direction of the negative of the normal,
        <m>-N(t)</m>. To get the torsion, which is the length of the
        vector in the previous formula, I can take the dot product
        with the unit vector in this direction, which is simply
        <m>-N(t)</m>.

      Now every curve has three associated scalars (speed, curvature,
      torsion) and three matching vectors (tangent, normal and
      binormal). Together, this information completely describes

          Like the straight line and the circle, the helix is the

    <title>Acceleration and Movement in Space</title>
    <p>
      Now that I understand how parametric curves describe motion in
      <m>\RR^3</m>, I can do a little physics. This section tries to
      undertstand what acceleration means in the language of
      parametric curves. The starting point is simple: acceleration
      should be the second derivative of the curve.
      <me>
        a(t) = \gamma^{\prime \prime}(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \gamma^\prime(t)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This means acceleration is a vector. I will try to work out its
      direction and magnitude, using <m>T</m>, <m>N</m> and <m>B</m>
      as reference for directions. Recall the definition of the unit
      tangent.
      <me>
        T(t) = \frac{\gamma^\prime(t)}{|\gamma^\prime(t)|}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      I solve for <m>\gamma^\prime(t)</m>.
      <me>
        \gamma^\prime(t) = \underbrace{|\gamma^\prime|}_{\text{ scalar
        } } \cdot \underbrace{T(t)}_{\text{ direction } }
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      I differentiate this, using the product rule.
      <men xml:id="equation-reference2">
          \frac{d}{dt} \gamma^\prime(t) = \left( \frac{d}{dt}
          |\gamma^\prime(t)| \right) T(t) + |\gamma^\prime(t)|
          \frac{d}{dt} T(t)
    </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall the definition of the normal.
      <me>
        N(t) = \frac{T^\prime(t)}{|T^\prime(t)|}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      I isolate <m>T^\prime(t)</m>.
      <men xml:id="equation-reference1">
        T^\prime(t) = |T^\prime(t)| N(t)
      </men>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, recall the definition of curvature.
      <me>
        \kappa(t) = \frac{|T^\prime(t)|}{|\gamma^\prime(t)|} \implies
        |T^\prime(t)| = \kappa(t) |\gamma^\prime(t)|
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      I use this expression to replace <m>|T^\prime(t)|</m> in <xref
      ref="equation-reference1">Equation</xref>.
      <me>
        T^\prime(t) = \kappa(t) |\gamma^\prime(t)| N(t)
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I put this expression for <m>T^\prime(t)</m> into the
      second term of <xref ref="equation-reference2">Equation</xref>,
      then group and label the terms.
      <me>
        a(t) = \underbrace{\frac{d}{dt} |\gamma^\prime(t)|}_{\text{
        linear acceleration } } T(t) + \underbrace{\kappa(t)
        |\gamma^\prime(t)|^2}_{\text{ angular acceleration } } N(t)
      </me>
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma(t): [a,b] \rightarrow \RR^3</m> be a
          parametric curve. Its <term>linear acceleration</term> is
          the vector <m>\frac{d}{dt} |\gamma^\prime(t)| T(t)</m> and
          its <term>angular acceleration</term> is the vector
          <m>\kappa(t) |\gamma^\prime(t)|^2 N(t)</m>. Linear
          acceleration described how quickly the speed changes.
          Angular acceleration describes how quickly the direction
          changes.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For the helix, <m>|\gamma^\prime(t)|</m> is constant, so the
          acceleration is entirely angular.
          <me>
            a(t) = 0 T(t) + r N(t) = r N(t)
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This makes sense, since the linear speed doesn't every
          change; only the direction changes as the helix curves and
          twists.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      You might wonder why this little bit of physics didn't include
      torsion. There is one derivative to get to the tangent and a
      second derivative to get to the normal and the binormal. To
      calculate torsion requires the derivative of the binormal: this
      is three derivatives away from the original curve. Torsion only
      shows up as a third derivative. The above discussion of
      acceleration only used second derivatives; indeed, acceleration
      can only describe motion in a plane. To get torsion and motion
      that diverges from its osculating plan requires a third
      derivative.
