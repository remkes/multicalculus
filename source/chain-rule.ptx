     I defined partial derivatives in <xref
     ref="section-partial-derivatives" /> to measure rates of change
     in a particular variable. I extended this in <xref
     ref="section-directional-derivatives" /> to change in any unit
     direction with directional derivatives. I can extend this even
     further, but considering the change in a function which moves
     along a <em>parametric curve</em> in the domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>f(x,y,z): \RR^3 \rightarrow\RR</m>, be a potential energy
      function. Let <m>\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))</m> be a curve
      moving through <m>\RR^3</m>. 
      I want to know how quickly energy is gained or lost 
      move along the path <m>\gamma</m>. The energy along
      <m>\gamma</m> is <m>f(\gamma(t)) = f(x(t), y(t), z(t))</m>. The
      rate of change is <m>\frac{df}{dt}</m>. But now <m>f</m> is a
      composition, <m>f(\gamma(t))</m>, so this must be a chain rule
      calculation. What is the chain rule when there are three (or
      more) components?

      This is a slightly strange extension of the single-variable
      chain rule. Originally, the chain rule was for any composition.
      However, the chain rule is very specifically for the composition
      of a scalar field with a parameteric curve. However, upon
      reflection, you could realize that this is really the only
      possibility. If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both functions
      <m>\RR^3 \rightarrow \RR</m>, then the composition <m>f \circ
      g</m> or <m>g \circ f</m> isn't even defined. The output of the
      first function is a scalar, but the input needs to be a vector.
      The only reasonable composition with a scalar field is to
      compose with a parametric curce, since a parametric curve
      outputs a vector. In Calculus IV, I will introduce  vector
      fields which could allow for other compositions, but for now,
      this is the only possibility.

          The variables are now mixed, so I have to make replacements.
          I replace  <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> with the matching
          components of the parametric curve. This matches the single
          variable chain rule: I differentiate then I replace the
          variable. The single variable notation, with the evaluation
          bar, is not typically used in multivariable situations.

          It would be  nice to know how the potential energy changes
          while moving along a curve <m>\gamma</m>. For a particular
          example, consider a helical path out of the
          gravity well:  <m>\gamma(t) = (\sin t, \cos t,
          t)</m>. I differentiate along this path using the chain
          rule.

          Along this helical path, the potential energy is increases.
          The rate of increase, however, slows over time. This makes
          sense for leaving a potential energy well: the first steps
          are more difficult and later movement is not as difficult.

          Notice that if I let <m>|\gamma(t)| = \sqrt{1 + t^2}</m> at
          the start, I could have written <m>P(t) =
          \frac{-GmM}{|\gamma(t)|} = \frac{-GmM}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}</m> and
          the <m>P^\prime(t) = \frac{GmMt}{\sqrt{(1+t^2)^3}}</m> could
          have been calculated directly. That would have been easier,
          but its nice to get confirmation that working with the chain
          rule leads to the right result.
