          Calculate and classify the extrema of the function
          <me>
            f(x,y) = \sqrt{xy + 1}
          </me>

        <p>
          First I calculate the gradient.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \nabla f(x,y) \amp = \left( \frac{y}{2\sqrt{xy+1}},
              \frac{x}{2\sqrt{xy+1}} \right) 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then I set the gradient equal to zero to find the critical
          points. This involves solving a system of two equations. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \frac{y}{2\sqrt{xy+1}} \amp = 0 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \frac{x}{2\sqrt{xy+1}}  \amp = 0 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          This is an easy system to solve. The fractions are zero only
          when their numerators are zero, so the only possibilities
          here are <m>x=0</m> and <m>y=0</m>.  This gives the critical
          point <m>(0,0)</m>. Then I calculate the determinant of the
          Hessian and evaluate it at the critical point.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              D \amp = \frac{\del^2 f}{\del x^2} \frac{\del^2 f}{\del y^2}
              - \left( \frac{\del^2 f}{\del x \del y} \right)^2 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              D \amp = \left( \frac{-y^2}{4(xy+1)^{\frac{3}{2}}}
              \right) \left( \frac{-x^2}{4(xy+1)^{\frac{3}{2}}}
              \right) - \left( \frac{xy+2}{4(xy+1)^{\frac{3}{2}}}
              \right)^2 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              D(0,0) \amp = 0 - \left( \frac{2}{4} \right)^2 =
              \frac{1}{4} 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          The Hessian determinant is negative, so the critical point
          at <m>(0,0)</m> is a saddle point.

          First I calculate the gradient.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \nabla f(x,y) \amp =  \left( 2x \ln xy + (x^2 - 1)
              \frac{1}{x}, (x^2-1) \frac{1}{y} \right) 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \left( 2x \ln (xy) + x - \frac{1}{x}, \frac{x^2 -
              1}{y} \right)
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then I set the gradient equal to zero to find the critical
          points. This involves solving a system of two equations. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              2x \ln (xy) + x - \frac{1}{x} \amp = 0 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \frac{x^2 - 1}{y} \amp = 0 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          I work with the second equation first. The numerator of this
          fraction needs to be zero, so <m>x^2 = 1</m>. This gives two
          possible <m>x</m> coordinates: <m>x = \pm 1</m>. For each of
          these <m>x</m> coordinates, I can replace <m>x</m> in the
          first equation and solve for <m>y</m>. First I substitute
          <m>x = 1</m>.
          <me>
            2 \ln (y) + 1 - 1 = 0 \implies \ln y = 0 \implies y =
            1
          </me>
          Then I substitute <m>x = -1</m>
          <me>
            -2 \ln (-y) - 1 + 1 = 0 \implies -\ln (-y) = 0 \implies y =
            -1
          </me>
          This gives me the critical points <m>(1,1)</m> and
          <m>(-1,-1)</m>.  Then I calculate the determinant of the
          Hessian and evaluate it at the critical point.
          <md>
            <mrow>

          The Hessian determinant is negative for points points, so 
          they are both saddle points.

          First I calculate the gradient.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \nabla f(x,y) \amp = \left( \cos (x) \cos (y), - \sin
              (x) \sin (y) \right) 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then I set the gradient equal to zero to find the critical
          points. This involves solving a system of two equations. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \cos x \cos y \amp = 0 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              -\sin x \sin y  \amp = 0 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          This is a complicated system. To make both terms vanish, I
          have to use <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as the zeros of sine or
          cosine in matching pairs. This gives two families of point.
          The first is 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \amp \left( n\pi, (2m+1) \frac{\pi}{2} \right) \amp \amp
              n,m \in \ZZ
            </mrow>
          </md>
          For this first family, the <m>x</m>
          coordinate makes the sine term vanish and the <m>y</m>
          coordinate makes the cosine term vanish. The second family
          does the opposite. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              \amp \left( (2n + 1) \frac{\pi}{2}, m\pi \right) \amp
              \amp n,m \in \ZZ
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Here, the <m>x</m> coordinate makes the cosine terms vanish
          and the <m>y</m> coordinate makes the sine terms vanish. 
          Then I calculate the determinant of the Hessian and evaluate
          it at the critical points (which I will have to do in
          families, since there are infinitely many critical points). 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              D \amp = \left( -\sin x \cos y \right) \left( -\sin x
              \cos y \right) - \left( - \cos x \sin y \right)^2 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = \sin^2 x \cos^2 y - \cos^2 x \sin^2 y 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          I have to analyse the two families of critical points. For
          the points in the family <m>\left( n\pi, (2m+1)
          \frac{\pi}{2} \right)</m>, <m>D = -1</m>, so all of these
          points are saddle points. For points in the family <m>
          \left( (2n+1) \frac{\pi}{2}, m \pi \right)</m>, <m>D =
          1</m>, so these are minima or maxima. I need to additionally
          look at <m>\frac{\del^2 f}{\del x^2} = -\sin x \cos y</m>.
          If <m>m,n</m> are both odd or both even, this partial
          derivative is negative and the critical point is a maximum.
          If one of <m>m,n</m> is odd and the other is even, this
          partial derivative is positive and the critical point is a
          minimum.

          First I calculate the gradient.

            <mrow>
              \nabla f(x,y) \amp = (3x^2y + 8xy + y, x^3 + 4x^2
              + x - 6) 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then I set the gradient equal to zero to find the critical
          points. This involves solving a system of two equations. 
          <md>
            <mrow>
              3x^2 y + 8xy + y \amp = 0

            </mrow>
          </md>
          I can work with the second equation first, since it only
          involves the <m>x</m> coordinate. This cubic has three roots
          <m>x = 1, -2, -3</m>. Then I look at the second equation,
          which I can factor.
          <me>
            y(3x^2  + 8x +  1) = 0 
          </me>
          I need to replace <m>x</m> with the three roots. However,
          none of the three roots will produce zero in the second
          factor in this equation. Therefore, to satisfy the first
          equation, I must set <m>y=0</m>.  This gives me the critical
          points <m>(1,0)</m>, <m>(-2,0)</m> and <m>(-3,0)</m>. Then I
          calculate the determinant of the Hessian and evaluate it at
          the critical points.

            <mrow>
              D \amp = (6xy + 8y)(0) - (3x^2 + 8x + 1)^2 = -(3x^2 + 8x

          <m>D</m> will always be negative, regardless of where I
          evaluate it. Therefore, all three points are saddlepoints.

          Then I set the gradient equal to zero to find the critical

          </md>
          I work with the second equation first. I can factor the left
          side.
          <me>
            (x)(y)(2x - 6) = 0 
          </me>
          This leads to three possibilities: <m>x=0</m>, <m>y=0</m>
          and <m>x=3</m>. I need to try all these possibilities in the
          first equation. Let me start with <m>x=0</m> and rewrite the
          first equation.
          <me>
            3(0)y^2 - 3y^2 - 8(0) = 0 \implies 3y^2 = 0 
          </me>
          This is solved only when <m>y=0</m>, so I get a critical
          point at <m>(0,0)</m>. If i start with <m>x=0</m>, I get the
          same critical point. Lastly, I need to check <m>x=3</m>.
          <me>
            3(3)y^2 - 3y^2 - 8(3) = 0 \implies 6y^2 = 24 \implies y^2
            = 8 
          </me>
          There are two solutions here: <m>y = \pm 2\sqrt{2}</m>. That
          gives two more critical points.  In total, I have three
          critical points <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(3, 2\sqrt{2})</m> and
          <m>(3, -2\sqrt{2})</m>. Then I calculate the determinant of
          the Hessian and evaluate it at the critical point.

          The test is inconclusive for <m>(0,0)</m>. By looking at the
          graph of the function, I could guess that there is a saddle
          point at the origin, but it is difficult to see this
          directly from the function. The Hessian determinant is
          negative for the other two critical points, so these are
          certainly both saddle points.
