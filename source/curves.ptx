    <title>Definition of Parametric Cuves</title>
    <p>
      The major goal of this course is the extension of calculus to
      multivariable functions. A parametric curve is a function with
      multiple outputs; these outputs are coordinates of position in
      some euclidean space depending on time; as such, parametric
      curves are used to talk about motion through space. The calculus
      of parametric curves is a way to understand the physics of such
      motion, covering both linear and angular velocity and
      acceleration in a nice, holistic approach.  When considering
      parametric curves, I like to imagine the movement of point-like
      objects through space under the influence of various forces.
      Projectiles with gravity and air friction is one imporant
      example; flying objects such as insects, birds or helicopters is
      a second; the motions of planets, moons and satellite under
      gravity is a third.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>parametric curve</term> in <m>\RR^n</m> is a continuous
          function <m>\gamma :[a,b] \rightarrow \RR^n</m>.
          As is convention, I will typically use the
          symbol <m>\gamma</m> for an arbitrary parametric curve.
          The output is often writen in component as follows (in
          <m>\RR^3</m> for demonstration).
          <me>
            \gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(y))
          </me>
          The functions <m>x(t)</m>, <m>y(t)</m> and <m>z(t)</m> are
          called the <term>component functionsi</term>. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      I can identify a parametric curve with its image: that is, I
      think of a curve as a decription of the set of points in
      <m>\RR^n</m> which are the output of the curve. In this
      interpretation, the curve describes motion along this set of
      points: it starts at the point <m>\gamma(a) \in \RR^n</m> and
      moves along the curve, ending at <m>\gamma(b) \in \RR^n</m> when
      it reaches the end of its domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The continuity condition is important, since a parametric
      curve is a connected path. I could define a
      function which jumps around, but it wouldn't really fit the
      notion of a curve <mdash /> it would not describe reasonable
      motion through space.
    </p>
    <p>
      For visualizing parametric curves, it is conventional to graph
      only the output or image of the curve. There is never a <m>t</m>
      axis in any of these graphs; instead, the variable <m>t</m> is
      the parameter of movement along the curve. Let me start with
      some basic examples. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The curve <m>\gamma(t) = (7t, 4t)</m> is a straight line in
          <m>\RR^2</m>. At <m>t=0</m>, it is at the origin. It then
          moves upward in the first quadrant: <m>(7,4)</m>,
          <m>(14,8)</m>, <m>(21,12)</m> and so on. It has slope
          <m>\frac{4}{7}</m>. It is a special case of a general
          construction. In <m>\RR^2</m>, any curve <m>\gamma(t) = (at,
          bt)</m> is a straight line through the orign with slope
          <m>\frac{b}{a}</m>. In <m>\RR^3</m>, any curve <m>\gamma(t)
          = (at, bt, ct)</m> is a straight line through the origin as
          well.

          The curve <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos t, \sin t)</m>, for <m>t
          \in [0, 2\pi]</m> traces out a circle, as in <xref
          ref="figure-parametric-curve1" />. This is an important
          example: many of the other curves I will use in this course
          are adaptations of the circle. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that I defined this curve on the domain <m>[0,
          2\pi]</m>. If I extend this domain, the curve just starts to
          retrace over the circle. It's good to observe that parametric
          curves can self-intersect and trace over themselves many
          times. This is a very different situation from, say, graphs
          of functions which cannot self-intersect.

          The form of this curve is similar to the circle, but the
          first component has a <m>2</m>, which doubles the period of
          the cosine function. The curve <m>\gamma(t) = (\cos 2t, \sin
          t)</m> on the domain <m>t \in [0, 2\pi]</m> oscillates faster
          in the <m>x</m> direction than in the <m>y</m> direction, as
          in <xref ref="figure-parametric-curve3" />. So, instead of a
          circle, I get a different kind of rotational movement, where
          the <m>x</m> coordinate oscillates faster than the <m>y</m>
          coordinate.

          Even though the shape of the curve is the same, the
          parametrization affects the rate movement along the curve.

      Coming to grips with the fact that the same shape can have
      multiple parametrizations is a major part of the conceptual
      challenge of parametric curves. When I calculate, I need to be
      conscious of the varied parametrizations. If I calculate the
      length of the shape, I want that length to be the same,
      regardless of how fast the movement is along the curve.
      Therefore, the length calculation should be independent of the
      parametrization. However, if I want to know details about the
      local movement (speed, acceleration, change in directions), then
      these calculations should depened on the parametrization.
      Different parametrizations will move along the curve at
      different rates, and therefore have different speeds,
      accelerations, etc. The next two sections work out all this
      calculus of parametric curves, and everything in those two
      sections will be careful with the variability of the
      parametrization.
