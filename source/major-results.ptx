  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="subsection-fundamental-theorems" />, I talked
      about the archetype of the fundamental theorem. 
      The fundamental theorem of line integrals was a
      version of the fundemental theorem that applied to vector fields
      and parametric curves. In this section, I want to talk about
      versions of the fundamental theorem for parametric surfaces. Let
      me remind you of the most general idea of the fundamental
      theorem. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \int_{\del D} f = \int_D df
    </me>
    <p>
      Here, <m>\del</m> is a boundary operator for geoemtric object
      and <m>df</m> is some kind of derivative of <m>f</m>. On one
      side, there is a derivative; on the other side, there is a
      boundary. So far, the boundaries of curves or intervals are just
      points. The right side is the <sq>integral</sq> of a function on
      two points, which is simply evaluation at the point. In this
      section, however, I'll be talking about surfaces. In general,
      the boundary of a surface will be a one dimensional object (a
      parametric curve, hopefully). There is no such thing as
      <sq>evaluation</sq> along a parametric curve; instead, there is
      a line integral. Therefore, I really do expect integrals on the
      right side of the archetypical equation. The full understanding
      of the fundamental theorem is that there are integrations on
      both sides: integral of a derivative on the right and
      integration over a boundary on the left. Before I get to the
      major results, though, I have to talk about boundaries.

    <title>Boundaries and Orientation</title>
    <p>
      In Calculus III, I defined a topological definition of a
      boundary. With apologies for poor use of terminology, the notion of
      boundary in this section is not topological. You could think of
      this as a geometric boundary or a parametric boundary, if you
      wanted to give it a different label. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boundary of a parametric object is the boundary in terms of
      the parameter. For a curve, the boundary is the endpoints,
      indicated by where the parameter starts and stops.
      Moreover, the curve has a direction. The boundary should reflect
      that direction. Therefore, boundaries of parametric objects are
      oriented boundaries. Orientation is going to mean something
      slightly different in each dimension. For curves, orientation 
      assigns signs to the end points. The starting point is
      labelled as negative and the ending point as positive, so that
      the curve proceeds from negative to positive. This also fits
      with the fundamental theorem of line integrals: the line
      integral of a conservative fields is the value of the potential
      at the end point (positive) minus the value of the potential at
      the starting point (negative). 
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not going to give a full, formal definition of the boundary
      of a parametric surface, because I don't want to get lost in the
      necessary technical details, Instead, for this course, I'll work
      with a less formal, more intuitive treatment of boundaries.
      Informally, the boundary of a parametric surface should be the
      one-dimensional edge of the surface, if such a thing exists. Let
      me give some examples to illustrate.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The boundary of a sphere is empty. There are no edges of the
          sphere, it just wraps around on itself. The same is true for
          many other objects The boundary of an ellipsoid is empty.
          The boundary of a cube is empty. The boundary of a cylinder
          which includes the top and bottom discs is empty. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A disc of radius <m>R</m> in the <m>xy</m> plane can be
          parametrized as a parametric surface. The boundary of the
          disc is the circle of the same radius. The circle is the
          edge of the disc: where the disc stops. Similarly, the
          boundary of a solid square is the edge of the square, and
          likewise for any two-dimensional shape which is treated as a
          parametric surface. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The boundary of a cylinder which does not include the top
          and bottom discs consists of two pieces: the circle at the
          top and the circle at the bottom. These circles are the edge
          of the cylinder, where is abruptly stops. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The boudary of a cone is a bit tricky. It certainly contains
          the circle at one end of the cone. What is less clear is
          whether the point at the other end of the cone is considered a
          boundary point. Informally, this could be argued several
          ways. For the purposes of this course, I will not treat such
          a point as a boundary point. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The boundary of a hemisphere is the circle at the edge of
          the hemisphere. 
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Hopefully, this is enough to get an informal sense of the
      boundary of a parametric surface. Now I need to talk about
      orientation. For curves, orientation came from the notion of
      direction: moving from the start to the end. For parametric
      surfaces, there isn't a direction of movement, but there is the
      direction of the normal. The normal defines a notion of above
      and below the surface, which is how I will treat orientation. By
      convention, the normal will point above, and the negative of the
      normal will point below. (Changing the order of the variables in
      the parametrization of a surface will change the order of the
      cross product, thus the sign of the normal.) 
    </p>
    <p>
      For parametric curves, orientation always works: all curves have
      starting points, ending points, and movement from the start to
      the end. However, not all surfaces have reasonable orientation.
      Locally, orientation is always fine. In a small part of a
      surface, the normal will point to one side of the surface and a
      notion of above and below can be defined. But these local
      orientations may not fit together into an orientation that works
      for the entire surface. The classic example is the Möbius strip:
      a cylindrical ring with a single twist in it. This object does
      not have properly defined sides. Many other surfaces have similar
      problems. A surface that has a reasonable orientation over the
      whole surface is called <term>orientable</term>. Surfaces which
      don't, like the Möbius strip, are <term>non-orientable</term>.
      The results of this section are going to rely on orientability. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I have (informal) notions of orientation for both parametric
      curves and parametric surfaces.  Typically, the boundary of an
      orientable parametric surface should be a parametric curve. How
      do the orientations interact? First, notice that the boundary of
      a parametric surface will always be a <term>closed</term> curve;
      that is, a curve with the same starting and endoing point. (It
      could be multiple closed curves, such as the two circles that
      bound an open cylinder, but each bounding curve can be dealt
      with separately as a closed curve.) Even
      more, I can expect for reasonable surfaces that the boundary is
      a <term>simple</term>, closed curve; that is, a closed curve
      with no self-intersection. Simple closed curves are cycles: they
      go around a loop. This loop could be smooth, like a circle or
      ellipse, or with sharp cornder, like a square or rectangle. I
      need a connection between the normal of the surface and the
      direction of the loop that forms its boundary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The connection is given by a right-hand-rule. The normal defines
      a side which is above the surface. Looking down at the surface
      from this above side, the boundary loop must go
      counter-clockwise. This is called a right-hand-rule because if
      the thumb of a right hand points in the directin of the normal,
      the fingers curl in this counter-clockwise direction. Note that
      this is a completely arbitrary convention: using clockwise
      curves and a left-hand-rule would have also given consistent
      mathematics, as long as the same rule is used consistently. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the theorems that follow in this section, I will be
      restricting to cases where all of this works: orientable
      surfaces; their simple, closed parametric curve boundarys; and
      compatible orientations according to this right-hand-rule. There
      are lots of ways that this setup can fail for certain surfaces.
      However, for most of the motivating applications, the surface
      are reasonable and can be parametrizated to fit these
      restriction. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The first surfaces in the list of examples above did not have
      boundaries (the sphere, the cube, etc.) Such surfaces are called
      <term>closed</term> surfaces. A closed surface 
      will invariable define an inside and an outside. By convention,
      the outside is above and the inside is below; therefore, the
      normals to closed surfaces should always point outwards, not
      inward. These closed surfaces themselves form the boundary of
      solid region in <m>\RR^3</m>. What is a solid region in <m>
      \RR^3</m>? Again, a technical, formal definition is not what I
      want here. Instead, I'll simply treat a solid region in
      <m>\RR^3</m> as any set in <m>\RR^3</m> whose boundary (now this
      is the actual topological boundary!) is a closed parametric
      surface. The solid cube has the hollow cube as its boundary; the
      solid sphere has the hollow sphere as its boundary; the solid
      cone has the hollow cone as its boundary; and so on. The solid
      region itself doesn't have any orientation. However, the
      orientation on the closed surface boundary must point outward,
      matching the convention I already established. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I have one more note concerning the boundary of objects
      discussed in this section. Let <m>\del</m> be the operator that
      takes the boundary of a solid region or parametric object.
      Consider these two situation that I've describe above.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Start with a solid region <m>D \subset \RR^3</m>. Then
          <m>\del D</m> is a closed parametric surface (with outward
          pointing normal. The boundary of a closed parametric
          surface is empty, so I could write <m>\del \del D =
          \emptyset</m>. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Start with a orientable parametric surface <m>\sigma</m>
          (not necessarily closed). Then the boundary <m>\del
          \sigma</m> is a close parametric curve (with compartible
          orientation given by a right-hand-rule). Since the curve is
          closed, its has no boundary. So again I could write <m>\del
          \del \sigma = \emptyset</m>. 
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is a general principle. For any reasonably defined
      geometric boundary operation <m>\del</m>, it should be true that
      <m>\del</m> satisfies <m>\del^2 S = \emptyset</m> for any
      reasonable geometric object <m>S</m>. By the end of the
      course, I want to use the archetype of the fundamental theorem to
      relate this fact to the composition of differential operators. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, let me remind you about a term defined in previous
      courses. A curve is called <term>piecewise differentiable</term>
      if it is differentiable except for isolated points. A piecewise
      differentiable curve is allowed to have isolate places with
      sharp corners. The boundary of a rectangle is a good example: it
      is differentiable everywhere except for the four corners of the
      rectangle. Line integrals of piecewise differentiable curves are
      well defined: I just do the line integral over the pieces and
      add up all the results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, I can define a piecewise differentiable parametric surface.
      This is a parametric surface that is differentiable everywhere
      except for some one-dimensional pieces. The hollow cube is a
      good example. I can parametrize the six faces of the cube with
      differentiable functions, but the six faces meet at sharp edges.
      Again, the flux integral of a piecewise differentiable
      parametric surface is well defined: I just do the flux integrals
      of the various pieces and add them up. Since the sharp edges are
      all one-dimensiona, they don't cause any problems for the two
      dimensional integral.

    <p>
      Having done a bunch or work on boundaries and orientation, I can
      finally state the two main theorems for vector calculus. These
      are both theorems that fit the archetype of the fundamental
      theorem. The first is called Stokes' Theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\sigma</m> be a piecewise differentiable oriented parametric
          surface in <m>\RR^3</m>, with boundary <m>\del \sigma =
          \gamma</m> a piecewise differentiable oriented closed curve. Let
          <m>F</m> be a <m>C^1</m> vector field defined on a
          neighbourhood of <m>\sigma</m>. Then the following equation
          is true. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_{\del \sigma} F \cdot ds = \int_\sigma (\nabla \times
          F) \cdot dA
        </me>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This is the archetype of the fundamental theorem. There is a
      differential operator on the right, the curl in this case. There
      is a boundary on the left, the boundary of a parametric surface
      in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second major theorem is called Gauss' Theorem. In some
      texts, this is called the divergence theorem. 
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>D</m> be a solid region in <m>\RR^3</m>
          whose boundary <m>\del D = \sigma</m> is a piecewise
          differentiable
          oriented closed parametric surface. Let <m>F</m> be a
          <m>C^1</m> vector field defined on a neighbourhood of
          <m>D</m>. Then the following equation is true. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_{\del D} F \cdot dA = \int_D (\nabla \cdot F) dV
        </me>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This theorem also has the desired form. There is a differential
      operator on the left, the divergence in this case. On the right
      there is a boundary operator, in this case the boundary of a
      solid region of <m>\RR^3</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I've presented two main theorems here. In many texts, there are
      three important theorems presented in the matching section .
      Historically as well, there were three theorem in this
      development of this theory. I only presented two theorems since
      the third theorem is actually just a special case of Stokes'
      Theorem. It is called Green's theorem and it applies to
      <m>\RR^2</m>; it is a special case of Stokes' Theorem because if
      you calculate Stokes' theorem and set the <m>z</m>
      coordinates of everything to zero (thus essentially working in
      <m>\RR^2</m>, the result is exactly Green's Theorem. I will,
      however, state it here. 
    </p>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>D</m> be a simply-connected region in <m>\RR^2</m>
          and let <m>F = (F_1,F_2)</m> be a <m>C^1</m> vector field
          defined on a neightbourhood of <m>D</m>. I can interpret
          <m>\RR^2</m> as the <m>xy</m> plane in <m>\RR^3</m> and
          extend <m>F</m> as <m>F = (F_1,F_2,0)</m> as a vector field
          in <m>\RR^3</m>. I can interpret <m>D</m> as a parametric
          surface in <m>\RR^3</m> which is restricted to the <m>xy</m>
          plane, using <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> as parameters and the
          identity function <m>D \rightarrow D</m> as <m>\sigma</m>.
          In this setting, appling Stokes' to gives Green's
          theorem, which is the following equation.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_{\del D} F \cdot ds = \int_D (\nabla \times F) \cdot
          dA = \int_D \left( \frac{\del F_2}{\del x} - \frac{\del
          F_1}{\del y} \right) dx dy
        </me>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Since these three named theorems are of similar form, they are
      often referred to as Gauss-Green-Stokes (or even GGS). All three
      of these people were 19th century mathematics/physicists and all
      of them were involved with the development of the physics of
      electricity and magnetism. In <xref ref="section-maxwell" />,
      I'll give the details of that project. This mathematics was
      specifically invented to describe electricity and magnetism,
      since no previous mathematics could describe the experimental
      results observed in these 19th laboratories and workshops.

  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-gauss-green-stokes-examples">
    <title>Direct Uses of Gauss-Green-Stokes</title>
    <p>
      The first use of GGS (what I will call the direct use) is using
      the equations of the theorem to change an integral into another
      integral. This can go in either directions: from left to right
      or right to left. There are many situations where the integral
      on one side is diffcult or impossible and the integral on the
      other side is reasonable.  I'll some examples of these direct
      uses. Some of these examples generalize into useful proposition,
      which I will also state. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          I'll start in <m>\RR^2</m> with Green's theorem. Let
          <m>F(x,y) = (\sin x, x^2 y^3)</m> and let <m>\sigma</m> be
          the triangle with vertices <m>(0,0)</m>, <m>(2,0)</m> and
          <m>(2,2)</m>. Then <m>\gamma</m> is the path in three
          straight lines from <m>(0,0)</m> to <m>(2,0)</m> to
          <m>(2,2)</m> and back to <m>(0,0)</m>. (This shows why
          piece-wise differentiable conditions are useful: allowing
          these sharp corners on the boundary path is very
          reasonable.) The line integral of <m>F</m> over
          <m>\gamma</m> could be calculated in three steps, by
          parametrizing each line segments and calculating those line
          integrals. However, I've prefer not to have to figure out
          these three parametrization. Green's theorem gives me an
          alternate way to calcaulate the line integral by integrating
          over the triangle.

          three pieces of the triangle, but I will use Stokes' theorem
          with the triangle as the surface. The triangle is flat, so

          The integal on the right is the integral over the empty set.
          There is no set to integrate over, so the value of the

          also zero.

    <title>Indirect Uses of Gauss-Green-Stokes</title>
    <p>
      The examples in the previous section used Gauss-Green-Stokes
      directly, changing the integral on one side of the equation to a
      (hopefully easier) integral on the other side of the equation.
      In this section, I want to demonstrate some trickier and more
      subtle uses of the theorems to calculate integrals. Let me start
      with an example. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the interal of <m>F = (z^2,
          y, xz)</m> over a closed curve <m>\gamma</m>. There isn't
          explicitly a surface here, but I can still try to apply Stokes'
          theorem. The curve is a closed curve, so it will be the
          boundary of some surface (in fact, inifinitely many
          surfaces). Let's say it is the boundary of some surface
          <m>\sigma</m> (I won't actually care about the other details
          of the surface). Then I apply Stokes' theorem. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_{\gamma} F \cdot ds = \int_{\sigma} \nabla \times F
          \cdot dA = \int_{\gamma} \left( 0, z, 0 \right) 
          \cdot dA
        </me>
        <p>
          Now consider the vector field <m>G(x,y,z) = \left(
          \frac{z^2}{2}, 0, 0 \right)</m>. The curl of this vector
          field is also <m>(0,z,0)</m>. I'll apply Stokes' theorem for
          the integral of the curl of this field over <m>\sigma</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_{\gamma} \left( 0, z, 0 \right) \cdot dA =
          \int_{\sigma} \nabla \times G \cdot dA = \int_{\gamma} G
          \cdot ds
        </me>
        <p>
          Now let me chain the two equalities together. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_{\gamma} F \cdot ds = \int_{\gamma} \left(
          0, z, 0 \right) \cdot dA = \int_{\gamma} G \cdot
          ds 
        </me>
        <p>
          What I've done here is replace the field <m>F</m>, which is
          quite complicated, with the field <m>G</m>, which is much
          easier to deal with. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      To make a general statement based on the previous example, I
      need a new definition. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> and <m>F</m> be <m>C^1</m> vectors fields with
          <m>G = \nabla \times F</m>. The field <m>F</m> is called a
          <term>vector potential</term> for <m>G</m>. (If I want to be
          careful with previous terminology, I'll use the term
          <term>scalar potential</term> to describe the potentials of
          conservative vector fields, in order to make clear which
          kind of potential is under discussion.)
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Now the previous example can be generalized into a proposition.
      Succinctly, for a line integral over a closed curve, I can
      replace the field with any other field which has the same curl.
      Here is the statement with all the necessary assumptions. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\gamma</m> be a closed curve and let <m>F(x,y,z)</m>
          and <m>G(x,y,z)</m> be <m>C^1</m> vector fields in the
          neighbourhood of <m>\gamma</m>. Let <m>\sigma</m> be a
          parametric surface with <m>\del \sigma = \gamma</m> such
          that <m>F</m> and <m>G</m> are defined in a neighood of
          <m>\sigma</m>. Then the line integrals of <m>F</m> and
          <m>G</m> over <m>\gamma</m> are equal if and only if
          <m>\nabla \times F = \nabla \times G</m>; that is, if
          <m>F</m> and <m>G</m> are vector potentials for the same
          field. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      I'd like to say a bit more about vector potential before moving
      on.  For scalar fields, I stated conditions to check if a field
      was conservative. I'd like to do the same here. For scalar
      fields, I checked the curl, because <m>\nabla \times \nabla f =
      0</m>.  Now, I also have the equation <m>\nabla \cdot (\nabla
      \times F) = 0</m>. So all fields which have a vector potential
      must have zero divergence. Is the inverse true? Again, it is
      true up to a topological condition. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F</m> be a <m>C^1</m> vector field defined on a
          simply connected open set. Then <m>F</m> has a vector
          potential if and only if <m>\nabla \cdot F = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      So, on a simply connected open set, the divergence checks for
      the existence of a vector potential. If the check works and a
      vector potential exists, how is it calculated? 
      If <m>F</m> is the vector potential for a field <m>G</m>, that
      means <m>\nabla \times F = G</m>. If I write this in components,
      I get a system of three differential equations.

      This system is usually prohibitively difficult. Moreover, this is a
      very underdetermined system. A field can have a huge variety of
      vector potentials. The system is much less determined than
      scalar potentials -- those potentials only differed by a
      constant. How much option is there for a vector potential? I'll
      give a proposition for this.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>G</m> be a <m>C^1</m> vector field on a simply
          connected open set. IF <m>F</m> is a
          vector potential for <m>G</m>, then for any scalar field
          <m>f</m>, <m>F + \nabla f</m> is also a vector potential.
          Equivalently, I can change <m>F</m> by adding any
          conservative vector field and it will still be a vector
          potential. Moreover, any other vector potential for <m>G</m>
          is of this form. 
        </p>
      </statement>

          I'll just calculate the curl of <m>F + \nabla f</m>

          \nabla \times (F + \nabla f) = \nabla \times F + \nabla \times

        </me>
        <p>
          If <m>H</m> is some other vector potential for <m>G</m>, let
          me calculate <m>\nabla times (F - H)</m>. 
        </p>
        <me>
          \nabla \times (F - H) = \nabla \times F - \nabla \times H =
          G - G = 0 
        </me>
        <p>
          The difference <m>(F-H)</m> has zero curl on the simply
          connected open set, so it is conservative. Therefore <m>F -
          H = \nabla f</m> for some scalar potential, which rearrnages
          to <m>H = F + \nabla f</m>. This proves the second part of
          the proposition, that any other vector potential has the
          desired form.

          In the previous example, the two fields had the same curl.
          Let me actually prove that their difference is conservative. 
          Again, let <m>G = (0,z,0)</m>. <m>F_a = (z^2, y, xz)</m>,
          <m>F_b = \left( \frac{z^2}{2}, 0, 0 \right)</m> are both
          vector potentials for <m>G</m>. Their difference must be a

        <p>
          If <m>\gamma</m> is any closed curve entirely in the

          Consider a windsock which is the surface of revolution of
          the function <m>y = \sqrt{1 - \frac{x}{3}}</m> for <m>x \in
          [0,3]</m>, with outward oriented normal. Let <m>F = (7, -z,
          y)</m> be a field describing the wind near the windsock.
          What is the flux through the windsock?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I can check <m>\nabla \cdot F = 0</m>, so <m>F</m>
          is incompressible and has a vector potential. Assume <m>F =
          \nabla \times G</m> for some vector potential <m>G</m>. If
          we call <m>D</m> the solid interior of the windsock, then
          the boundary of <m>D</m> is the windsock and the circle at
          its mouth. I will  label the circle <m>\mu</m> and consider it a
          parametric surface with normal in the <em>negative</em>
          <m>x</m> direction. Then I apply Gauss twice, once in each
          direction.  The first integral in the middle piece of the
          equation  is zero since <m>\nabla \times F = 0</m>; this is
          just the integral of zero over a solid region in
          <m>\RR^3</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_{\sigma} F \cdot dA = \int_{D} \nabla \cdot F dV -
          \int_\mu F \cdot dA = -\int_\mu F \cdot dA
        </me>
        <p>
          This tells me that I can actually change the surface of
          integration via Gauss' theorem, at least when the field is
          incompressible. I'm not going to give a second argument for
          the same result, this time using Stokes' theorem. 
          Let <m>\gamma</m> be the boundary of the
          circle, which is the same as the boundary of the windsock
          excet that the the curve must go in a different direction to
          match the orientation. (The negative sign reflects that
          change in direction and orientation.)

        <p>
          The result of either Guass' or Stokes' here is the same.
          Since the field is incompressible, I can 
          with a much easier surface: a disc of radius <m>1</m> in the
          <m>yz</m> plane, parametrized as <m>\mu(r,\theta) = (0,
          r\cos \theta, r \sin \theta)</m> for <m>r \in [0,1]</m> and
          <m>\theta \in [0, 2\pi]</m>. We calculate the flux,
          reversing the conventional order of the cross product to
          account for the normal in the negative <m>x</m> direction.

      I can generalize the previous example into another proposition.
      This roughly says that for flux integrals of incompressible
      fields, the surface can be changed as long as the boundary is
      preserved.

      I have one more example of an indirect use of GGS. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>F = (y, z e^{y^2}, x + z^2 e^{z^2})</m> and let
          <m>\gamma</m> be the semicirlce from <m>(-3,0,0)</m> to
          <m>(3,0,0)</m> which lies in the positive <m>y</m> part of
          the <m>xy</m>plane. What is the line integral?
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I can check that <m>\nabla \times F = (-1,1,0)</m>,
          so the field is not conservative. I might seem that no
          theorem can help here. The field is not conservative, so the
          fundamental theorem of line integrals doesn't apply. The
          curve is not closed, so Stokes' theorem doesn't apply. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I can do something clever to make sure one of the
          theorems applies. 
          Consider the path <m>\delta</m> from <m>(3,0,0)</m> to
          <m>(-3,0,0)</m> along the <m>x</m> axis. Then <m>\gamma</m>
          followed by <m>\delta</m> is a closed path which is the
          boundary of the half-circle of radius <m>3</m> in the
          <m>xy</m> plane. Call the half circle <m>\sigma</m>. Using
          this as the surface, I can apply Stokes' theorem. F
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_{\del \sigma} F \cdot ds = \int_\sigma (\nabla
          \times F) \cdot dA
        </me>
        <p>
          The line integral over <m>\del \sigma</m> is the line
          integral over <m>\delta</m> plus the line integral over
          <m>\gamma</m>. Writing the two line integral, I can solve
          for the line integral over <m>\gamma</m>.
        </p>
        <me>
          \int_\gamma F \cdot ds = \int_\sigma (\nabla \times F)
          \cdot dA - \int_\delta F \cdot ds
        </me>
        <p>
          This clever use of Stokes' theorem has changes the original
          integral into two integrals. This might seem
          counterproductive, but 
          these two integrals on the right are notably easier than the
          first integral. <m>\delta</m> is entirely on the <m>x</m>
          axis, so <m>F = (0,0,x)</m> when <m>y = z = 0</m>. The
          tangent to <m>\delta</m> is <m>(1,0,0)</m> so <m>F \cdot N =
          0</m>, which means the second integral on the right vanishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The normal to <m>\sigma</m> is <m>(0,0,-1)</m>, pointing in
          the negative <m>z</m> direction to match orientation.
          <m>(\nabla \times F) \cdot N = (-1,1,0) \cdot (0,0,-1) =
          0</m>, so the first integral on the right also vanishes.
          Together, I can conclude that the original line integral is
          also zero. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the field is not conservative, so a different path
          from <m>(-3,0,0)</m> to <m>(3,0,0)</m> might have a
          different value. If I worked in the <m>xz</m> plane
          instead of the <m>xy</m> plane with the same setup, the
          second integral would still vanish but the normal to
          <m>\sigma</m> would be <m>(0,-1,0)</m>, so <m>(\nabla \times
          F) \cdot N = (-1)</m> and the value of the first integral
          would be non-zero.

    <title>Strategies for Line and Surface Integrals</title>
    <p>
      Through the many examples in this section, a variety of uses
      of the theorems have been presented. Let me give you a
      convenient list to describe the various strategies that I've
      introduced. I'll state the most important conditions for
      applying these strategies, but I won't state all the
      conditions each time. (Basically, assume that the fields are
      <m>C^1</m> on the appropriate sets and the parametric objects
      are piecewise differentiable and have compatible orientations
      when required.)

          For line integrals of conservative fields, the line
          fundamental theorem of line integrals applies and the line
          integral can be calculed by finding a (scalar) potential
          and evaluating the potential on the endpoints.

          For line integrals over closed curves, Stokes' theorem can

          integral of the curl over some surface whose boundary is
          the closed curve.

          For flux integrals over any surface, if the field has a

          change the flux integral into a line integral of the
          vector potential over the boundary of the surface.

          For flux integrals over closed surfaces, Guass' theorem

          interated integral of the divergence of the field over the
          solid region contain within the surface.

          For triple integrals over a solid region in <m>\RR^3</m>,
          if the scalar field being integrated is the divergence of
          some vector field, Guass' theorem can be applied to change
          the triple integral into a flux integral of the vector
          field over the boundary of the region.

          For a line integral of a field <m>F</m> over a closed

          <m>G</m> as long as they have the same curl.
