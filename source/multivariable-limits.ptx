    <title>Definition of Limits of Multivariable Functions</title>
    <p>
      I want to re-establish the tools of calculus for multi-variable
      functions. As with single-variable functions, the starting
      point is limits. Again, as with single-variable functions, limit
      are required for the definition of both the deriavtive and the
      integral. I'll start with the full, formal,
      <m>\epsilon-\delta</m> definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> be a function. Let
          <m>(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)</m> be a point in <m>\RR^n</m>.
          Then the statement
          <me>
            \lim_{(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \rightarrow (a_1, a_2,
            \ldots, a_n)} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = L
          </me>
          means that <m>\forall \epsilon > 0</m> <m>\exists \delta >
          0</m> such that if <m>|(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) - (a_1, a_2,
          \ldots, a_n)| \lt \delta</m> then <m>|f(x_1, x_2, \ldots,
          x_n) - L| \lt  \epsilon</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The definition is essentially the same as the single-variable
      definition: as the input gets closer and closer to a specific
      point, the output gets closer and closer to a fixed value
      <m>L</m>. The only issue is that <sq>closer and closer</sq> now
      happens in <m>\RR^n</m> instead of <m>\RR</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <m>\RR</m>, there were only two directions of approach: from the
      left and from the right. If the behaviour from both sides was
      the same, then the limit existed. In <m>\RR^n</m> for <m>n
      \geq 2</m>, there are infinitely many ways to approach any given
      point. I can approach along lines in infinitely many
      directions out from the point. Even more, I can approach along
      other paths, such as spiral paths or strange jagged paths.
      This makes it much more difficult to determine the behaviour and
      much more difficult to prove existence of various limits.
      However, I do have some good news. First, the definition of
      continuity remains the same.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> is called
          continuous at <m>(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)</m> if the limit
          approaching <m>(a_1,a_2, \ldots, a_n)</m> exists and is the
          same as <m>f(a_1,a_2, \ldots, a_n)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      So limits for continuous functions are still reasonable: I just
      evaluate. But what functions are continuous?
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f: \RR^n \rightarrow \RR</m> is continuous if
          and only if it is continuous independently in each of its
          variables.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      This is the first application of a very important technique:
      treating the function as a function of only one variable
      and ignoring the others, pretending that they are constant. If
      I do that, I end up consider <m>n</m> different single variable
      functions.  The proposition says that the function is continuous
      in the new definition if and only if all of the <m>n</m>
      different single variable functions are continuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proposition tells me how to recognize continuous functions.
      Anything involving polynomials, roots, rational functions, trig,
      exponentials and logarithms is continuous on its domain.

    <title>Evaluating Multivariable Limits</title>
    <p>
      As I mentioned before, proving the existence of limits is
      difficult. However, the algebraic techniques of first year
      calculus can still work for calculations. Here are some
      examples where I can use algebraic manipulation to simplify
      limits so that they can be evaluated. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <me>
            \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} \frac{x^2 - y^2}{x-y} 
            = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} \frac{(x-y)(x+y)}{(x-y)}
          </me>
            The limit cannot be directly evaluated. However, with the
            factoring of the numerator, I can cancel of the
            <m>(x-y)</m> term. That removes the division by zero
            problem and lets me evaluate the limit.
          <me>
            = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} x+y = 0 + 0 = 0
          </me>
          This limit means that no matter which direction I choose to
          approach <m>(0,0)</m> from, the function gets closer and
          closer to zero. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <me>
            \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (4,1)} \frac{ xy - 4y^2}{\sqrt{x}
            - 2\sqrt{y}} = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (4,1)}
            \frac{(xy - 4y^2)(\sqrt{x} + 2\sqrt{y})}{(\sqrt{x} - 2
            \sqrt{y})(\sqrt{x} + 2 \sqrt{y})} 
          </me>
          This is another limit that cannot be directly evaluated,
          since it has type <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>. To deal with this
          denominator, I will multiply by its conjugate (in both
          numerator and denominator, of course). The conjugate gets
          rid of the square roots in the denominator
          <me>
            = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (4,1)} 
            \frac{(xy - 4y^2)(\sqrt{x} + 2\sqrt{y})}{x - 4y} 
          </me>
          Then I can factor a <m>y</m> out of the numerator and find a
          common term, <m>(x-4y)</m>, which I can cancel off.
          <me>
            = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (4,1)} \frac{y(x - 4y)(\sqrt{x}
            + 2\sqrt{y})}{x - 4y} = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (4,1)}
            y(\sqrt{x} + 2\sqrt{y})
          </me>
          At the end, having removed the division by zero, I just
          evaluate the limit.
          <me>
            = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (4,1)} y(\sqrt{x} + 2\sqrt{y}) =
            (1)(\sqrt{4} + 2 \sqrt{1}) = 2 + 2 = 4
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <me>
            \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (1,2)} \frac{\sqrt{y} -
            \sqrt{x+1}}{y-x-1} = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (1,2)}
            \frac{(\sqrt{y} - \sqrt{x+1})(\sqrt{y} + \sqrt{x+1})}{(y - x 
            - 1)(\sqrt{y} + \sqrt{x+1})}
          </me>
          This is another limit where multiplying by a conjugate is
          helpful. The conjugate removes the square roots from the
          numerator.
          <me>
            = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (1,2)}
            \frac{(y-x-1)}{(y-x-1)(\sqrt{y} + \sqrt{x+1})}
          </me>
          Then I can cancel off the common term, which removes the
          division by zero. After that, I can simply evaluate the
          limit. 
          <me>
            = \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (1,2)} \frac{1}{\sqrt{y} +
            \sqrt{x+1}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2}} =
            \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      When a limit doesn't exist, I can prove its non-existence by
      looking at various directions of approach. If the limit along
      different directions is different, then there can be no cohesive
      limit. There are several ways to do this, depending on what kind
      of approach I want to take. I'll do two examples with different
      paths of approach, each chosen to suit the specific function
      under consideration.

          This limit depend on the choice of <m>m</m>. I can get
          infinitely many values (all between 0 and 1) out of this
          limit depending on which line I use to approach
          <m>(0,0)</m>. With all these possible answers, the limit
          cannot exist. It is interesting to try to visualize the
          graph: as the values get close to zero, there are pieces of the
          graph getting close to any number between <m>0</m> and
          <m>1</m>. <xref ref="figure-3d-graph2">Figure</xref> shows
          some of this behaviour: approaching from the front of figure
          leads to <m>0</m>, but approaching from the sides leads to
          larger numbers. (The graph is slightly flawed, due to the
          graphing algorithm. The two cliffs should meet, even though
          the graph shows a gap between them. Where the two cliffs
          meet is the line with all the problematic limits.)

          In this example, I approach along parabolic paths of the
          form <m>x = m y^2</m>. This lets me replace <m>x</m> with
          <m>my^2</m> and get a single variable limit. Like the
          previous example, I get a limit that depends on the path of
          approach, so I conclude that the limit cannot exists.

            \lim_{(x,y) \rightarrow (0,0)} \frac{3xy^2}{x^2 + y^4} =
            \lim_{y \rightarrow 0} \frac{3my^4}{m^2 y^4 + y^4} =

    <p>
      It is important to note that this technique (choosing multiple
      paths of approach) can only be used to proves that limits fail.
      It cannot be used to prove that limits exists (at least not in
      the way that I have presented it here), since it doesn't cover
      any possible path of approach.
