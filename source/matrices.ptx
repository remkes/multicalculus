  <title>Linear Transformations</title>
    <p>
      This section is a short detour into a few definitions from
      linear algebra. This is necessary to state the important results
      in the section immediately following.

          Let <m>L</m> be a function <m>\RR^n \rightarrow \RR^m</m>.
          Then <m>L</m> is called a <term>linear transformation</term> 
          if the follow two properties hold for all <m>u, v, \in
          \RR^n</m> and <m>a \in \RR</m>.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <m>L(u + v) = L(u) + L(v)</m>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>L(au) = aL(u)</m>
          </li>
        </ol>

      Linear transformations are the functions which are studies in
      linear algebra. They are a very restricted class of function:
      most expression to not preserve addition and scalar
      multiplication in this way. Note that by using <m>a=0</m> in the
      second property, a linear transformation must always send the
      zero vector to the zero vector
    </p>
    <p>
      As limited as they are, linear transformations are a key
      definition in algebra and geometry. They also have a very
      elegant catalogue and calculation method, which involves
      matrices. Very briefly, let me define a matrix.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>matrix</term> is a rectangular array of numbers. It
          has a number of rows and columns; if there are <m>n</m> rows
          and <m>m</m> columms, then it is called a <m>n \times m</m>
          matrix. If the number of rows and columns are the same, it
          is called a <term>square</term> matrix. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Here is an example of a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix where the
      entries are real number. 
    </p>
    <me>
      \begin{pmatrix} 
        \sqrt{7} \amp 0 \amp \frac{1}{e} \\
        \frac{-15}{31} \amp \pi \amp 5 \\
        0 \amp 0 \amp 0 
      \end{pmatrix}
    </me>
    <p>
      Matrices are used for a huge number of purposes in mathematics.
      For this course, we will only need a couple. The first is one of
      the most notable and surprising facts in mathematics.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The set of all linear transformation <m>\RR^n \rightarrow
          \RR^m</m> is precisely and perfectly catalogued by the <m>m
          \times n</m> matrices. That is, for each such linear
          transformation, there is exactly one matrix that describes
          it and each matrix describes such a transformation.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      How is this done? It is done by the matrix action on vectors:
      there is a clear and algorithmic way that a matrix can be used
      to take a vector as input and produce another vector as output.
      I'll state the matrix action just in <m>\RR^3</m> for square
      matrices, but it applies to any size of matrix. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be a <m>3 \times 3</m> matrix and
          <m>(x,y,z)</m> be a vector in <m>\RR^3</m>. Then, writing
          the matrix out as nine entries, the following formula
          defines the matrix action. (Usually, the vector would be
          written vertically for this action, but I'll write it
          horizontally to conform to the notation of this course.
          That'll look a bit wierd to those who have done linear
          algebra with me -- sorry). 
        </p>
        <me>
          \begin{pmatrix} 
            a \amp b \amp c \\
            d \amp e \amp f \\
            g \amp h \amp i
          \end{pmatrix} (x,y,z) = 
          (ax + by + cz, de + ey + fz, gx + hy + iz)
        </me>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The details of calculating the matrix action won't actually
      be that important for us, but I do want you to know that the
      action exists. For now, there is a second property of matrices
      which we will need.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>M</m> be a square matrix. The there is a real number,
          called the determinant of M and written <m>\det(M)</m>,
          with two properties: the absolute value <m>|\det(M)|</m> is
          the multiplicative effect that <m>M</m> has as a linear
          tranformation on volume (or the appropriate equivalent in
          other dimension); and the sign of the determinant records
          the effect of <m>M</m> on orientation, with positive
          preserving orientation and negative reversing orientation.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>  
      Again, the details here won't be extremely important for us, so
      if you don't know exactly what I mean by multiplicative effect
      on volume or what orientiation is, that's fine. It's enough to
      know that this determinant exists and carries important
      geometric meaning. Likewise, calculating determinants is also
      not going to be required: I will either explicilty give you the
      determinant calculations or such calculations can be done by
      computer.
