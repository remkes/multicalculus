    <title>Motivation</title>
    <p>
      For the last few sections, I've focused heavily on the force
      example of fields. Now, let me return to the idea of a fluid flow.
      Conisder a field <m>F</m> that describes the flow of water or air
      currents. If I have a net or other porus object in the field, then
      unless the flow is perfectly across the edge of the object, some
      amount of the medium will be flowing through the net. Is there a
      way to measure such a thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      This seems like a difficult project. The net can have a
      complicated geometry. At different points on the net, the
      interaction with the fluid can vary. If could be flowing through
      one part of the net in one direction, but in the opposite
      direciton through another part. I'd like a way to put all this
      together into some kind of collective sense of the flow through
      the net.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll look back at line integrals for motivation. For line
      integrals, I looked at the interaction of a parametric curve and a
      field. To do that, I needed the tangent to the curve, so that I
      could take the dot product to measure the interaction. That
      tangent came from the parametrization.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm going to need something similar to describe the net -- I need
      a two dimensional analogue of a parametric curve. Such a thing is
      called a parametric surface (with a formal definition to follow
      below. For this section, I'll be defining parametric surfaces and
      giving some examples. <xref ref="section-flux-integrals" /> will
      then use parametric surfaces to try to answer the motivation
      question of flow through a net.

          Let <m>D \subset \RR^2</m> be a simply connected
          set. A <term>parametric surface</term> in <m>\RR^n</m> is a
          continuous function

    </definition>
    <p>
      Even though the definition is given for any <m>\RR^n</m>, for
      the purpose of this course, I'll assume that all surface are in
      <m>\RR^3</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Like parametric curves, we visualize surfaces only by their
      outputs. The input set <m>D</m> isn't visualized; rather, it is
      thought of as the parameter space. The difference, compared to
      curves, is that we now have a 2-dimensional parameter space. This
      allows two independent directions of movement on the surface. I
      lose the notion of travelling in time with the parameter
      <m>t</m>. Instead, there are two parameters (with conventional
      variable <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>). I can move independently in
      either variable. Between moving in either parameter, I can range
      over all the points in the output. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again similar to a curve, each coordinate is a scalar function
      of the parameter.

      Typically, parametric surfaces are use to give a parametrization
      to an already known 2-dimensional object: planes, a hollow
      spheres, cones, cylinders, etc. Let me work through some
      examples of this.

    <example xml:id="example-surface-graph">
      <statement>
        <p>
          In Calculus III, I analyzed graphs of scalar fields. In
          particular, for a scalar field on two variables
          <m>f(x,y)</m>, the graph is a surface in <m>\RR^3</m>. In
          Calculus III, I used gradients to interpret these surfaces
          as altitudes; contour plots were the equivalent of
          topographical maps. Now, I can also treat these as
          parametric surfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assume <m>f(x,y)</m> is a scalar field on a
          simply-connected domain <m>D</m>. Then using the same
          <m>D</m> as the parameter domain, the surface
          <m>\sigma (u,v) = (u,v,f(u,v))</m> is a parametric
          description of the graph of the function.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example xml:id="example-surface-revolution">
      <statement>
        <p>
          In calculating volumes in Calculus II, I introduced the idea
          of a surface of revolution. Such a surface is formed by
          taking the graph of a single variable function <m>y =
          f(x)</m>, and spinning it around the <m>x</m> axis to create
          a surface in <m>RR^3</m>. Such surfaces always have circular
          cross-section, resembling something that might be formed on
          a lathe. I can also describe them as parametric surfaces
        </p>
        <p>
          The axis of the surface of revolution is unchanges. The
          other two axes have rotation; parametrically, that is given
          by sine and cosine. Let <m>f(x)</m> be a continuous function
          on <m>[a,b]</m>. Let <m>D = [a,b] \times [0,2\pi]</m>. Then
          the surface of revolution is describe as a parametric
          surface on the parameter domain <m>D</m>.

        <p>
          I don't have to use <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> as the variable of
          the paremtrization. If I want to be reminded that one of the
          parameter is the angle of a rotation, I'll use
          <m>\theta</m>. If one of the parameter perfectly aligns with
          the <m>x</m>, <m>y</m> or <m>z</m> axis in on the surface,
          it's reasonable to call that the parameter. In that was, a
          surface of revolution about the <m>x</m> axis on the
          parameter domain <m>D = [a,b] \times [2,\pi]</m> can be
          described this way.

          Location on the sphere can be described, then, by the same
          logitude and colatitude used for spherical coordnations.
          This should be the parameter domain: 
          <m> D = [0, 2\pi] \times [0, \pi]</m>. Then the sphere is

    <title>Calculus of Parametric Surfaces</title>
    <p>
      The calculus of parametric curves started with the tangent
      vector. All the other constructions (arclength, curvature,
      torsion) were based on that starting point. For parametric
      surface, there isn't a unique tangent, since there isn't a
      unique parameter. Like the graphs of multivariable functions,
      there is a higher-dimensional tangent object. Since I am
      restricting my attention to surface in <m>\RR^3</m> in this
      course, instead of a tangent line, a surface (if it is
      differentiable) has a tangent plane. In <m>\RR^3</m>, a plane is
      describe by a normal. Therefore, the important piece of
      information for a parametric surface is the normal to the
      tangent plane. Like the tangent vector for a parametric curve,
      the normal will be the key to the calculus of parametric curve.
      Let me move on the definition. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A parametric surface <m>\sigma: D \rightarrow \RR^3</m> is
          called a <m>C^1</m> surface if all the partial
          derivtive of both components of <m>\sigma</m> exist and are
          continuous. For a <m>C^1</m> parametric surface
          <m>\sigma</m>, write <m>\sigma_u</m> for the vector of
          partial <m>\left( \frac{\del \sigma_1}{\del u}, \frac{\del
          \sigma_2}{\del u}, \frac{\del \sigma_3}{\del u} \right)</m>
          and likewise for <m>\sigma_v</m> with partials in the
          variable <m>v</m>. For such a surface, the <term>normal
          vector</term> is the vector <m>\sigma_u \times \sigma_v</m>.
          A parametric surface is called <term>non-singular</term> if
          its normal is never the zero vector. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Let me make a couple of points aobut this definition. First,
      because I'm using the cross product, this definition only works
      in <m>\RR^3</m>. There are notions of tangents and normals to
      parametric surfaces in higher dimensions, but more machinery is
      needed to define these tangents and normals. To do so moves in
      to the study of differentiable manifolds. Second, I can think of
      the <m>C^1</m> condition saying that the parametric curve has no
      sharp corners (and no singularities of the parametrization,
      which I'll discuss in examples later). A natural term for having
      no sharp concers would be <sq>smooth</sq>. Unfortunately, this
      has a slightly different definition. A <term>smooth parametric
      surface</term> (alternatively a <m>C^\infty</m> parametric surface)
      is a parametric surface where all higher partial derivatives, of
      any degree, exist and where the normal is never zero. For the
      purpose of this course, most of the surface I introduce will be
      smooth; I could use this terminology if I wanted, saying
      <sq>smooht</sq> instead of <sq><m>C^1</m> and non-singular</sq>.
      However, only <m>C^1</m> is required for the definition of the
      normal.

          I factored out the common term in the normal. After
          factoring out this, I see that the resulting normal is
          precisely same as the original position. So, the normal is a
          multiple of the position. This makes sense: for a sphere
          centred at the origin, the vector that points out of the
          sphere at point (as a local direction vector) has the same
          direction as the vector from the origin to that point.

          The normal is <m>(0,0,0)</m> when <m>\phi = 0</m>, which
          happens at the top and bottom poles of the sphere. These
          points are singularities of the parametrization. This was
          the same problem for spherical coordinates: the longitude is
          not propely defined at the north and south poles. The sphere
          itself is a surface without sharp corners, but the system of
          parametrization is the problem. It breaks down at the poles.

          vertical component, which is expected. Unlike the cylinder,
          the vector point out from the cylinder should point
          updwards.
