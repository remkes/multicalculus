    <title>Definition of a Locus</title>
      <p>
        There are many ways to mathematically describe an geometric
        object. Cartesian geometry allows for perhaps the most
        powerful idea: the locus. I'll define this in <m>\RR^3</m>,
        but the definition is general to any Euclidean space. 
      </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider an equation in the variables <m>x,y,z</m>. The
          <term>locus</term> in <m>\RR^3</m> of this equation is the
          set of vectors that satisfy the equation. The plural of
          locus is <term>loci</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In general, the equation can be of any sort. The unit circle in
      <m>\RR^2</m> is most commonly defined as the locus of the
      equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>. The graph of a single-variable
      function is the locus (also in <m>\RR^2</m>) of the equation
      <m>y = f(x)</m>. My goal in this section is to describe the
      equations of planes, which are flat. Flat objects arise as loci
      of linear equations.  Let me remind you of that definition.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="definition-linear-equation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m> and <m>d</m> be real
          numbers. A <term>linear equation</term> in the variables
          <m>x,y,z</m> is an equation of the following form.
          <me>
            a x + b y + c z = d 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The most familiar linear loci are lines. Very briefly, let me
      redefined a line in <m>\RR^2</m>. (A line in <m>\RR^3</m> needs
      a different definition; in this course, one way to describe
      lines is as parametric curves, as in <xref
      ref="section-parametric-curves" />.)
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>line</term> in <m>\RR^2</m> is the locus of the
          equation <m>ax + by = c</m> for <m>a,b,c \in \RR</m>. 
          The line goes through the origin if <m>c=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The plane in <m>\RR^3</m> is define in a very similar manner. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>plane</term> in <m>\RR^3</m> is the locus of the
          linear equation <m>ax + by + cz = d</m>.  The plane goes
          through the origin if <m>d=0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Notes that the equation for a locus is not unique; many
      equations may describe the same locus. Since they are equations,
      I can change them by doing the same thing to both sides (hence
      preserving the equality). Consider the plane given by this
      equation.
      <me>
        3x - y + 5z = 12
      </me>
      I can multiply both sides by <m>-1</m> and still describe the
      same plane. 
      <me>
        -3x + y - 5z = -12
      </me>
      I could also multiply the original equation by any constant, say
      <m>100</m>, and still describe the same plane. 
      <me>
        300x - 100y + 500z = 1200
      </me>
      Finally, I must be careful multiplying by zero (or any
      expression that might evaluate to zero). If I multiply both
      sides of the equation by zero, I get a trivial equation.
      <me>
        (0)(3x - y + 5z) = (0)(12) \implies 0 = 0 
      </me>
      The equation <m>0=0</m> describes all points, not just the
      plane, so I have destroyed the locus. (As with many other places
      in mathematics, you should always keep half a thought to the
      risk of multiplying or dividing by zero.)

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-dot-product-and-loci">
    <title>Dot Products and Loci</title>
    <p>
      Loci are the solutions to one or more linear equations. These
      linear equation can be re-interpreted and expressed via dot
      products. Consider, again, the  linear equation in
      <m>\RR^3</m>.
      <me>
        ax + by + cz = d 
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      I can think  of the variables <m>a,b,c</m> as the components of
      a vector <m>u = (a,b,c) \in \RR^3</m>. Let me use <m>v</m> to
      also label the vector of variables: <m>v = (x,y,z)</m>.
      I can re-write the linear equation using these
      two vectors.
      <md>
        <mrow>
          ax + by + cd \amp = d
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          (a,b,c) \cdot (x,y,z) \amp = d 
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
          u \cdot v \amp = d 
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, a linear equation specifies that the dot product
      result of a variable vector <m>v</m> with a fixed vector
      <m>u</m> must have the result <m>d</m>. In this light, a
      plane in <m>\RR^3</m> is given by the equation
      <me>
        (a,b,c) \cdot (x,y,z) = d
      </me>. 
      This plane is precisely all vectors whose dot product with the
      vector <m>(a,b,c)</m> produces 
      the fixed number <m>d</m>. If <m>d=0</m> (i.e., if the plane
      goes through the origin), the equation become 
      <me>
        (a,b,c) \cdot (x,y,z) = 0
      </me>. 
      A dot product of zero indicates that the two inputs to the dot
      product are perpendicular. Therefore, a plane through the origin
      is the set of all vectors which are perpendicular to a fixed
      vector <m>(a,b,c)</m>. This leads to an important definition. 
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="definition-plane-normal">>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>P</m> be a plane in <m>\RR^3</m> determined by the
          equation 
          <me>
            (a,b,c) \cdot (x,y,z) = d 
          </me>.
          The vector <m>(a,b,c)</m> is called the <term>normal to the
          plane</term>. (Recall that <sq>normal</sq>, in mathematics,
          can be a synonym of <sq>perpendicular</sq>.) 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If <m>d=0</m>, the plane or hyperplane is perpendicular to its
      normal. The remarkable thing is this: the notion of orthogonality of
      the normal still works when <m>d \neq 0</m>. In this case, the
      normal is a <em>local</em> perpendicular direction from any
      point on the  plane.  Treating any such point as a local origin,
      the normal points in a direction perpendicular to all the
      <em>local direction</em> vectors which lie on the plane. This is
      the key of understanding and describing planes in <m>\RR^3</m>.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-planes-algorithm">
    <title>An Algorithm for Equations of Planes</title>
    <p>
      Now I can build a general process for finding the equation of a
      plane in <m>\RR^3</m>. Using the equations above, I need two
      pieces of information: the (local direction) normal
      <m>(a,b,c)</m> and the constant <m>d</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm going to describe three ways of calcualting the equation of
      a plane in <m>\RR^3</m>, each starting from different initial
      information. All three of these collections of data uniquely
      determines a plane.
      <ul>
        <li>
          A point and the normal.
        </li>
        <li>
          A point and two local directions. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Three points.
        </li>
      </ul>
      I'll describe the algorithm for all three of these in order,
      since each consecutive case reduces to the previous. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first description, I am actually given the normal
      <m>(a,b,c)</m> and some point <m>(x_0, y_0, z_0)</m> on the
      plane, I only need to calculate <m>d</m>. To do so, I just
      evaluate the left side of the equation in <xref
      ref="definition-plane-normal" />: doing so is equal to the right
      side, which is just <m>d</m>. Let me show some examples. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Say that I am given the normal <m>(0, -2, -3)</m> and the
          point <m>(1,-7,5)</m>. What is the unique plane described by
          this data?
        </p>
        <p>
          I calculate the left side of the equation of the plane,
          which is the dot product of the point and the normal. This
          will result in the constant <m>d</m>. 
          <me>
            (0,-2,-3) \cdot (1, -7, 5) = 0 + 14 - 15 = -1 = d
          </me>
          So <m>d = -1</m>, which means I can write the equation of
          the plane. The coefficients of the variables are the
          coordinates of the normal.
          <me>
            0x - 2y - 3z = -1 
          </me>
          There is always some variability in how to write these
          equations. Since the <m>x</m> variable is multiplied by
          zero, I can remove it. I can also multiply both sides by
          <m>-1</m> if I wanted to.
          <me>
            2y + 3z = 1 
          </me>
          This equation also describes the same plane. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Say that I am given the normal <m>(-5, 1, 4)</m> and the
          point <m>(0,3,11)</m>. What is the unique plane described by
          this data?
        </p>
        <p>
          I calculate the left side of the equation of the plane,
          which is the dot product of the point and the normal. This
          will result in the constant <m>d</m>. 
          <me>
            (-5,1,4) \cdot (0,3,11) = 0 + 3 + 44 = 47 
          </me>
          So <m>d = 47</m>, which means I can write the equation of
          the plane. The coefficients of the variables are the
          coordinates of the normal.
          <me>
            -5x + y + 4z = 47
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Say that I am given the normal <m>\left( \frac{-4}{7},
          \frac{-11}{13}, \frac{5}{2} \right)</m> and the
          point <m>\left( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{-1}{2}, \frac{-4}{13}
          \right)</m>. What is the unique plane described by
          this data?
        </p>
        <p>
          I calculate the left side of the equation of the plane,
          which is the dot product of the point and the normal. This
          will result in the constant <m>d</m>. 
          <me>
            \left( \frac{-4}{7},\frac{-11}{13}, \frac{5}{2} \right)
            \cdot \left( \frac{1}{4}, \frac{-1}{2}, \frac{-4}{13}
            \right) = \frac{-4}{28} + \frac{11}{26} - \frac{20}{26} =
            \frac{-89}{182} 
          </me>
          So <m>d = -\frac{89}{182}</m>, which means I can write the
          equation of the plane. The coefficients of the variables are
          the coordinates of the normal.
          <me>
            \frac{-4}{7} x - \frac{11}{13} y + \frac{5}{2} z =
            \frac{-89}{182} 
          </me>
          Again, there is variability in how to write the equation. If
          I wanted to clear denominators, I could multiply through by
          <m>182</m>. 
          <me>
            -104x - 154y + 455 z = -89 
          </me>
          This equation also describes the same plane. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Second, if I am given a point on a plane and two local
      directions on the plane, then I need to construct the normal
      first. The normal is perpendicular to any local direction on the
      plane. This is where the cross product comes in: the cross
      product is a operation which takes two vectors and produces a
      third vector perpendicular to the first two. Therefore, the
      cross product of the two local directions is the normal. After I
      have the normal, I can proceed as before, using the equation and
      the point to calculate the constant <m>d</m>. Let me do one
      example.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Say that I am given the point <m>(0, 3, 7)</m> and the local
          directions <m>(-1, -5, 3)</m> and <m>(-5, 0, 1)</m>. What is
          the equation of the plane described by this data? 
        </p>
        <p>
          I take the cross product of the two local directions to ge
          the normal to the plane.
          <me>
            (-1,-5,3) \times (-5,0,1) = (-5 - 0, -15 - (-1), 0 - 25) =
            (-5, -14, -25) 
          </me>
          Then I proceed as before. 
          I calculate the left side of the equation of the plane,
          which is the dot product of the point and the normal. This
          will result in the constant <m>d</m>. 
          <me>
            (-5, -14, -25) \cdot (0,3,7) = -42 - 175 = -217 
          </me>
          So <m>d = -217</m>, which means I can write the
          equation of the plane. The coefficients of the variables are
          the coordinates of the normal.
          <me>
            -5x - 14y - 25 z = -217
          </me>
          I could multiply through by <m>-1</m> to make everything
          positive, if I wanted.
          <me>
            5x + 14y + 25 z = 217
          </me>
          This equation also describes the same plane. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Finally, a plane can be determined by three points (as long as
      the three points do not all lie on the same line). If I am given
      three points (<m>p</m>, <m>q</m> and
      <m>r</m>), then I can use <m>p</m> as the local origin and
      construct the local direction vectors as <m>q-p</m> and
      <m>r-p</m>. Then I can proceed as in the previous step: the
      normal is the cross product of the two local direction, <m>(q-p)
      \times (r-p)</m>. Finally, I finish with the first step, using
      the normal and a point to find the constant <m>d</m>. Note, with
      this data, I have three points to chose from for this final
      step. All three should work and produce the same constant. If
      they fail to do so, that means there is an error earlier in the
      work somewhere. I'll do an example to show all the steps. 
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What is the equation of the plane determined by the three
          points <m>(0,4,0)</m>, <m>(-3, -6, 2)</m> and <m>(-7, 0,
          1)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I need to calculate the local directions. I'll set
          <m>(0,4,0)</m> as my local origin. Then I calculate the
          differences of the two other points from this point.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              (-3, -6. 2) - (0,4,0) = (-3, -10, 2) 
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              (-7, 0. 1) - (0,4,0) = (-7, -4, 1) 
            </mrow>
          </md>
          These are the two local directions. Then I proceed as with
          the previous case. I start by taking the cross product of
          the two local directions to get the normal to the plane.
          <md>
            <mrow>
              (-3, -10, 2) \times (-7, -4, 1) \amp = (-10 - (-8),
              (-14), - (-3), 12 - 70)
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              \amp = (-2, -11, -58)
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Then I again proceed as before, going back to the very first
          case.  I calculate the left side of the equation of the
          plane, which is the dot product of the point and the normal.
          This will result in the constant <m>d</m>. I use the first
          point, but I could use any of the three points. 
          <me>
            (-2, -11, -58) \cdot (0,4,) = 0 - 44 + 0 = -44 
          </me>
          So <m>d = -44</m>, which means I can write the
          equation of the plane. The coefficients of the variables are
          the coordinates of the normal.
          <me>
            -2x - 11y - 58 z = -44
          </me>
          I could multiply through by <m>-1</m> to make everything
          positive, if I wanted.
          <me>
            2x + 11y + 58z = 44
          </me>
          This equation also describes the same plane. 
        </p>
      </statement>
