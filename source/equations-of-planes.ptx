    <title>Definition of a Locus</title>
    <p>
      Spans were the first way to define linear and affine subspaces.
      There is another approach to describe these object, which I
      describe in this section. I'll start with the main definition.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider any set of equations in the variables
          <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m>. The <term>locus</term> in
          <m>\RR^n</m> of this set of equations is the set of vectors
          that satisfy <em>all</em> of the equations. The plural
          of a locus is <term>loci</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      In general, the equations can be of any sort. The unit circle
      in <m>\RR^2</m> is most commonly defined as the locus of the
      equation <m>x^2 + y^2 = 1</m>. The graph of a function is the
      locus of the equation <m>y = f(x)</m>. However, linear
      algebra excludes curved objects. The subset is concerned with 
      linear/affine objects: things that are straight and flat. So, I
      don't want loci of just any kind of equation: I want loci of
      linear equations. The idea is likely familiar, but let me
      formally define it anyway. 
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="definition-linear-equation">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a_i</m> and <m>c</m> be real numbers. A <term>linear
          equation</term> in the variables <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n</m>
          is an equation of the following form.
          <me>
            a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n = c
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      <xref ref="proposition-spans-subspaces" /> claimed that all
      linear subspaces were described by spans. Shortly afterward, I
      showed that all affine subspaces were described by offset spans.
      In addition to spans, I can also use loci to describe any affine
      or linear subspace. 
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Any linear or affine subspace of <m>\RR^n</m> can be
          described as the locus of finitely many linear equations.
          Likewise, the locus of any number of linear equations is
          either an affine subspace of <m>\RR^n</m> or the empty set.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      It is quite valuable to have these two different descriptions of
      linear and affine subspaces. Each description (spans or loci)
      has strengths and weaknesses. Depending on what calculations I
      want to do, using either a span or a locus description may help
      a great deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a nice contrast in the constructions of spans and
      loci. Spans are essentially built up by adding more and more
      vectors, more and more directions. The span of no vectors is the
      origin. The span of one vector is a line. The span of two
      linearly independent vectors is a plane. This process continues
      (if the ambient dimension is large enough) to make object of
      higher and higher dimensions as more linearly independent
      vectors are added to the span. 
    </p>
      In contrast, loci are built top-down, by starting with the
      ambient space and reducing the number of points by imposing
      restrictions in the form of linear equations. The locus of no
      equations is the entire space, since all points trivially
      satisfy no equations. The locus of one equation should be
      something of one dimension less that the ambient space, as one
      restriction is imposed. The locus of two equations should be
      something of two dimensions less than the ambient space, as two
      restrictions are imposed. This continues: the dimension of a
      locus, at least ideally, is the dimensions of the ambient space
      minus the number of equations or restrictions. 
    <p>
      To be more specific, in <m>\RR^2</m>, adding the equation
      <m>x=3</m> restricts to a vertical line passing through the
      <m>x</m>-axis at <m>\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}</m>.
      Likewise, the equation <m>y=4</m> restricts to a horizontal line
      passing through the <m>y</m>-axis at <m>\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 4
      \end{pmatrix}</m>.  If I consider the locus of <em>both</em>
      equations, there is only one point remaining: <m>\begin{pmatrix}
      3 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}</m> is the only point that satisfies both
      equations. In this way, each additional equation potentially
      adds an additional restriction and leads to a smaller linear or
      affine subspaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with spans, there can be the problem of redundant
      information. In <m>\RR^3</m>, the locus of the equation <m>x + y
      + z = 1</m> is a plane. If I also add the equation <m>2x + 2y +
      2z = 2</m>, however, I don't get a line. The second equation is
      a multiple of the first, and any points that satisfy the first
      equation also satisfy the second. The second equation is
      redundant and unnecessary. Determining what is redundant (and
      determining the dimension of a locus) will rely on calculation
      tools introduced in <xref ref="section-dimensions-loci" />.

      I can define some familiar objects which are presented as the

          A <term>line</term> in <m>\RR^2</m> is the locus of the
          equation <m>ax + by = c</m> for <m>a,b,c \in \RR</m>. In
          general, the line is affine. The line is linear if

    <p>
      If we think of a plane in <m>\RR^3</m> as the locus of one

      than its ambient space <m>\RR^3</m>.

          = c</m>. It has dimension <m>n-1</m>. It is, in general,

          If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets, their intersection <m>A

          The intersection of affine subspaces is also an affine
          subspace. If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are both linear, the

      <statement>
        <p>
          Loci of more than one equation can be understood as
          intersections. Consider
          the locus of two equations, say the example I used from
          <m>\RR^2</m> before: the locus of <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=4</m>.
          I defined this directly as a single locus. However, I
          could just as easily think of this as the intersection of
          the two lines given by <m>x=3</m> and <m>y=4</m> separately.
          In this way, it is the intersection of two loci. Similarly,
          all loci are the intersection of the planes or hyperplanes
          defined by each individual linear equation.

  <subsection xml:id="subsection-dot-product-and-loci">
    <title>Dot Products and Loci</title>
    <p>
      Loci are the solutions to one of more linear equations. These
      linear equation can be re-interpreted and expressed via via dot
      products. Consider, again, the general linear equation in
      <m>\RR^n</m>.
      <me>
        a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \ldots + a_n u_n = c
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of the variables <m>u_i</m> as the components of a vector
      <m>u \in \RR^n</m>. There also are <m>n</m> scalars <m>a_i</m>,
      which I can likewise treat as components of the vector <m>a \in
      \RR^n</m>. The vector <m>u</m> is variable; the vector <m>a</m>
      is constant. Then I can re-write the linear equation using these
      two vectors.
      <me>
        a_1 u_1 + a_2 u_2 + \ldots + a_n u_n = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\
        a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} u_1
        \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n \end{pmatrix} = a \cdot u = c
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, a linear equation specifies that the dot product
      result of a variable vector <m>u</m> with a fixed vector
      <m>a</m> must have the result <m>c</m>. In this light, an
      affine plane in <m>\RR^3</m> is given by the equation
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix} 
          x \\ y \\ z 
        \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 
          a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 
        \end{pmatrix} = c
      </me>. 
      This plane is precisely all vectors whose dot product with the
      vector <m>\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}</m> is
      the fixed number <m>c</m>. If <m>c=0</m>, the equation become 
      <me>
        \begin{pmatrix} 
          x \\ y \\ z 
        \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 
          a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 
        \end{pmatrix} = 0
      </me>. 
      A dot product of zero indicates that the two inputs to the dot
      product are perpendicular. Therefore, a plane through the origin
      is the set of all vectors which are perpendicular to a fixed
      vector <m>\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}</m>.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>P</m> be a plane in <m>\RR^3</m> determined by the
          equation

          </me>.
          The vector <m>\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3
          \end{pmatrix}</m> is called the <term>normal to the
          plane</term>. Let <m>H</m> be a hyperplane in <m>\RR^n</m>
          determined by the equivalent equation in <m>\RR^n</m>.

    <p>
      If <m>c=0</m>, the plane or hyperplane is perpendicular to its
      normal. This notion of orthogonality still works when <m>c \neq
      0</m>. In this case, the normal is a <em>local</em>
      perpendicular direction from any point on the affine plane.
      Treating any such point as a local origin, the normal points in
      a direction perpendicular to all the <em>local direction</em>
      vectors which lie on the plane.

      Now I can build a general process for finding the equation of a
      plane in <m>\RR^3</m>. Any time I have a point <m>p</m> on the
      plane and two <em>local direction vectors</em> <m>u</m> and
      <m>v</m> which remain on the plane, I can find a normal to the
      plane by calculating <m>u \times v</m>. Then I can find the

      If I am given three points on a plane (<m>p</m>, <m>q</m> and

      construct the local direction vectors as <m>q-p</m> and
      <m>r-p</m>. The normal is <m>(q-p) \times (r-p)</m>. In this
      way, I can construct the equation of a plane given three points
      or a single point and two local directions.
