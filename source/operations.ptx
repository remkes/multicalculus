      In this section, I go through the basic arithmetic of vectors.
      In some ways, it mimics the arithmetic of scalars; in other
      ways, scalar operations no longer work and are replaced with
      other operations.

          The <term>sum</term> of two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in
          <m>\RR^n</m> is the sum taken component wise.

            u + v = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n
            \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\
            v_n \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 + v_1 \\ u_2 + v_2

      The sum is visualized by placing the start of the second vector
      at the end of the first, as in <xref

      can only add two vectors in the same dimension. I can't add a
      vector in <m>\RR^2</m> to a vector in <m>\RR^3</m>.

      Though there will be other <sq>multiplications</sq> to come, it

      scalars. Scalar multiplication is visualized by scaling the
      vector by the value of the scalar. (Hence the term
      <sq>scalar</sq>!) If the scalar is negative, the direction is
      also reversed, as in <xref

      Scalar multiplication also lets me define the difference between
      vectors.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The difference between two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is
          the vector <m>u + (-1)v</m>, defined using addition and
          scalar multiplication. This works out to be componentwise
          subtraction.
          <me>
            u - v = u + (-1) v= \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots
            \\ u_n \end{pmatrix} + (-1) \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\
            \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 - v_ 1\\

    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          With respect to some set of scalars (such as <m>\RR</m>),
          whenever I find a mathematical structure that has the two
          properties of addition and scalar multiplication, I call
          the structure <term>linear</term>. <m>\RR^n</m> is a linear
          space because vectors allow for addition and scalar
          multiplication.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>length</term> of a vector <m>u</m> in <m>\RR^n</m>
          is written <m>|u|</m> and is given by a generalized form of
          the Pythagorean rule for right triangles.
          <me>
            |u| = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This length is also called the <term>norm</term> of the
          vector. A vector of length one is called a <term>unit
          vector</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If I think of vectors as directions from the origin towards a
      point, this definition of length gives exactly what I expect:
      the physical length of that arrow in <m>\RR^2</m> and
      <m>\RR^3</m>. Past <m>\RR^3</m>, I don't have a natural notion
      of length. This definition serves as a reasonable
      generalization to <m>\RR^4</m> and higher dimensions, which I
      can't visualize. Note also that <m>|u| = 0</m> only if <m>u</m>
      is the zero vector. All other vectors have a positive length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often the square root is annoying, and I find it convenient to
      work with the square of the length.
      <me>
        |u|^2 = u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The notions of length and difference allow me to define the
      distance between two vectors.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>distance between two vectors</term> <m>u</m> and
          <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is the length of their difference:
          <m>|u-v|</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      You can check from the definition that <m>|u-v| = |v-u|</m>, so
      distance doesn't depend on which comes first. If <m>|\cdot|</m>
      were absolute value in <m>\RR</m>, this definition would match
      the notion of distance between numbers on the number line.
      Difference and length are visualized in <xref
      ref="figure-difference-and-length" />.

      The last line deserves some attention for the notation. When I
      write <m>|a| |u|</m>, <m>|a|</m> is an absolute value of a real
      number and <m>|u|</m> is the length of a vector. The fact that
      they have the same notation is frustrating, but these notations
      are common. (Some text use double bars for the length of a
      vector, <m>||v||</m>, to avoid this particular issue.)

    <p>
      Earlier, I said that I couldn't multiply two vectors together.
      That's mostly true: there is no general product of two vectors
      <m>uv</m>, which is still a vector, as least none that has any
      useful or reasonable geometric meaning.  However, there are
      other kinds of <sq>multiplication</sq> which combine two
      vectors. The operation defined in this lecture multiplies two
      vectors, but the result is a scalar.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>dot product</term> or <term>inner product</term>
          or <term>scalar product</term> of two vectors <m>u</m> and
          <m>v</m> is given by the following formula.
          <me>
            u \cdot v = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n
            \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots
            \\ v_n \end{pmatrix} = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + \ldots + u_n
            v_n

        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      I can think of the dot product as a scalar measure of the
      similarity of direction between the two vectors. If the two
      vectors point in a similar direction, their dot product is
      large, but if they point in very different directions, their dot
      product is small. This is a bit strange, since there already is
      a measure, at least in <m>\RR^2</m>, of this difference: the
      angle between two vectors. Thankfully, the two measures of
      difference agree, and the dot product can be expressed in terms
      of angles.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>angle</term> <m>\theta</m> between two non-zero
          vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is given by
          the follow equation.
          <me>
            \cos \theta = \frac{u \cdot v}{|u||v|}

    <p>
      This definition agrees with the angles in <m>\RR^2</m> and
      <m>\RR^3</m>, which I can visualize. However, this serves as a
      new <em>definition</em> for angles between vectors in all
      <m>\RR^n</m> when <m>n \geq 4</m>. Since I can't visualize those
      spaces, I don't have a way of drawing angles and calculating
      them with conventional trigonometry. This definition allows me
      to extend angles in a completely algebraic way. Notes that
      this angle <m>\theta \in [0, \pi]</m>, since I can always choose
      the smallest possible angle between two vectors. This means that
      the inverse cosine is unique for this calculation.

          Two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> are called

      There are many pairs of orthogonal vectors. Thinking of the dot
      product as a multiplication, I have uncovered a serious
      difference between the dot product and the conventional
      multiplication of numbers. If <m>a,b\in \RR</m>, then
      <m>ab=0</m> implies that one of <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> must be
      zero. For vectors, it can be true that <m>\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0
      \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} 
      = 0</m> even though neither factor in the product is the zero
      vector. Here is a definition to keep track of this new
      property.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Assume <m>A</m> is a set with addition and some kind of
          multiplication. Also assume that <m>0 \in A</m>. If <m>u
          \neq 0</m> and <m>v \neq 0</m> but <m>uv =0</m>, then
          <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are called <term>zero
          divisors</term>.

      An important property of ordinary numbers, as I just noted, is
      that there are no zero divisors. Other algebraic structures,
      such as vectors with the dot product, may have many zero
      divisors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I have defined a new operation, it is useful to see how
      it interacts with previously defined structures. I'll take up
      the proofs of these in <xref ref="section-proofs-week2" /> and

           <me>
            |u-v|^2 = (u-v) \cdot (u-v) = u \cdot u - v \cdot u - u \cdot
            v + v \cdot v
          </me>
          Then I can interchange the order of the second term, since the
          dot product is commutative.
          <me>
            |u-v|^2 = u \cdot u - u \cdot v - u \cdot v + v \cdot v
          </me>
          Then I can group the middle terms.
          <me>
            |u-v|^2 = u \cdot u - 2u \cdot v + v \cdot v
          </me>
          Then I can interpret the first and last terms as length squared. 
          <me>
            |u-v|^2 = |u|^2 - 2u \cdot v + |v|^2 
          </me>
          Then I can reorder the terms.
          <me>
            |u-v|^2 = |u|^2 + |v|^2 - 2u \cdot v 
          </me>
          Finally, using the definition of angle, I can replace the dot
          product with <m>|u||v| \cos \theta</m>, where <m>\theta</m> is
          the angle between the two vectors. 
          <me>
            |u-v|^2 = |u|^2 + |v|^2 - 2|u||v| \cos \theta
          </me>
          This is the cosine law.

    <title>Definition of the Cross Product</title>
    <p>
      The dot product is an operation that can be performed on any
      two vectors in <m>\RR^n</m> for any <m>n \geq 1</m>. There are
      no other conventional products that work in all dimensions.
      However, there is a special product that works in three
      dimensions.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>u = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3
          \end{pmatrix}</m> and <m>v = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\
          v_3 \end{pmatrix}</m> be two vectors in <m>\RR^3</m>. The
          <term>cross product</term> of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is
          written <m>u \times v</m> and defined by the following
          formula.
          <me>
            u \times v = \begin{pmatrix} u_2v_3 - u_3v_2 \\ u_3v_1 -
            u_1v_3 \\ u_1v_2 - u_2v_1 \end{pmatrix}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The cross product differs from the dot product in several
      important ways. First, it produces a new vector in
      <m>\RR^3</m>, not a scalar. For this reason, when working in
      <m>\RR^3</m>, the dot product is often referred to as the
      <term>scalar product</term> and the cross product as the
      <term>vector product</term>. Second, the dot product measures,
      in some sense, the similarity of two vectors. The cross product
      measures, in some sense, the difference between two vectors. The
      cross product has a greater magnitude if the vectors are closer
      to being perpendicular. If <m>\theta</m> is the angle between
      <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>, the dot product was expressed in terms of
      <m>\cos \theta</m>. This measures similarity, since <m>\cos 0 =
      1</m>.  There is a similar identity for the cross product.
      <me>
        |u \times v| = |u||v| \sin \theta
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      This identity tells me that the cross product measures
      difference in direction, since <m>\sin 0 = 0</m>. In
      particular, this tells me that <m>|u \times u| = 0</m>, implying
      that <m>u \times u = 0</m> (the zero vector is the only vector
      which has zero length). This is another new and strange
      property: in this particular multiplication, everything squares
      to zero. The cross product is obviously very different from the
      multiplication of scalars, where <m>a^2 = 0</m> cannot happen
      unless <m>a=0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also consider the relationship between <m>u</m> and
      <m>u \times v</m> as calculated through the dot product.

          u \cdot (u \times v) \amp = 
          \begin{pmatrix}
          u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3  
          \end{pmatrix} \cdot
          \begin{pmatrix}
          u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2 \\ u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3 \\ u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1
          \end{pmatrix}
        </mrow>

          \amp = u_1u_2v_3 - u_1u_3v_2 + u_2u_3v_1 - u_2u_1v_3 +
          u_3u_1v_2 - u_3u_2v_1 = 0
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar calculation shows that <m>v \cdot (u \times v) =
      0</m>. Since a dot product of two vectors is zero if and only
      if the vectors are perpendicular, the vector <m>v \times u</m>
      is perpendicular to both <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>. This turns out
      to be a very useful property of the cross product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, a calculation from the definition shows that <m>u
      \times v = -(v \times u)</m>. So far, multiplication of scalars
      and the dot product of vectors have not depended on order. The
      cross product is one of many products in mathematics which
      depends on order. If I change the order of the cross product,
      I introduce a negative sign.

        <p>
          Products that do not depend on the order of the factors,
          such as multiplication of scalars and the dot product of
          vectors, are called <term>commutative products</term>.
          Products where changing the order of the factors introduces
          a negative sign are called <term>anti-commutative
          products</term>. The cross product is an anti-commutative
          product. Other products that have neither of these
          properties are called <term>non-commutative
          products</term>.

    <title>Angular Motion</title>
    <p>
      An important application of the cross product is found in
      describing rotational motion. Linear mechanics describes the
      motion of an object through space, but rotational mechanics
      describes the rotation of an object independent of its movement
      through space. A force on an object can cause both kinds of
      movement, obviously. The following table summarizes the
      parallel questions of linear motion and rotational motion in
      <m>\RR^3</m>.

    <p>
      How should I describe torque?  If there is a linear force applied
      to an object which can only rotate around an axis, and if the
      linear force is applied at a distance <m>r</m> from the axis, I
      can think of the force <m>F</m> and the distance <m>r</m> as
      vectors. The torque is then <m>\tau = r \times F</m>. Notice
      that <m>|\tau| = |r||F| \sin \theta</m>, indicating that linear
      force perpendicular to the radius gives the greatest angular
      acceleration. That makes sense. If <m>F</m> and <m>r</m> share
      a direction, then I am pushing directly along the axis, and no
      rotation can occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of cross products in rotational dynamics is ubiquitous.
      In fluid dynamics, local rotational motion of the fluid result
      in turbulence, vortices and similar effects. Tornadoes and
      hurricanes are particularly extreme examples of vortices. All
      the descriptions of the force and motion of these vortices
      involve cross products in the vectors describing the fluid.
