    <title>Vector Arithmetic</title>
    <p>
      In this section, I introduce/review the basic arithmetic of
      vectors. I'll define the operations in <m>\RR^3</m>; for
      <m>\RR^2</m>, all the operations are the same just without the
      third component. Likewise, by adding more component, I can
      extend these operations to any <m>\RR^n</m>. The exception is
      the cross-product, which is unique to <m>\RR^3</m>. 
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>sum</term> of two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in
          <m>\RR^3</m> is the sum taken component wise. This means
          that the first two entries are added to produce the first
          entry of the sum, and likewise for the second and third
          entries. 
          <me>
            u + v = (u_1,u_2,u_3) + (v_1,v_2,v_3) = (u_1 + v_1, u_2 +
            v_2, u_3 + v_3)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The sum is visualized by placing the start of the second vector
      at the end of the first, as in <xref
      ref="figure-visualizing-vector-addition" />. Note that I
      can only add two vectors in the same dimension. I can't add a
      vector in <m>\RR^2</m> to a vector in <m>\RR^3</m>.

          multiplication by <m>a</m> in each component of <m>u</m>.
          By convention, scalar multiplication is written with the

      Though there will be other <sq>multiplications</sq> to come, it
      is mostly true that I can't multiply vectors together in any way
      reminiscent of numbers. Instead, I can only multiply by
      scalars. Scalar multiplication is visualized by scaling the
      vector by the value of the scalar. (Hence the term
      <sq>scalar</sq>!) If the scalar is negative, the direction is
      also reversed, as in <xref

      Scalar multiplication also lets me define the difference between
      vectors.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The difference between two vectors <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is
          the vector <m>u + (-1)v</m>, defined using addition and
          scalar multiplication. This works out to be componentwise
          subtraction.
          <me>
            u - v = u + (-1) v= (u_1, u_2,u_3) + (-1) (v_1, v_2, v_3) 
            = (u_1 - v_1, u_2 - v_2, u_3 - v_3)
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>length</term> of a vector <m>u</m> in <m>\RR^3</m>
          is written <m>|u|</m> and is given by a generalized form of
          the Pythagorean rule for right triangles.
          <me>
            |u| = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          This length is also called the <term>norm</term> of the
          vector. A vector of length one is called a <term>unit
          vector</term>. I'm using the notation <m>|u\</m>. Other
          sources may use the notation <m>\lVert u \rVert</m>, mostly
          to distinguish the notation from the absolute value of
          numbers. I prefer the single bar notation, but it is
          important to note that length of vectors and absolute value
          are different definitions: one applies to scalar and one to
          vectors. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      If I think of vectors as directions from the origin towards a
      point, this definition of length gives exactly what I expect:
      the physical length of that arrow in <m>\RR^2</m> and
      <m>\RR^3</m>.  Note also that <m>|u| = 0</m> only if <m>u</m>
      is the zero vector. All other vectors have a positive length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often the square root is annoying, and I find it convenient to
      work with the square of the length.
      <me>
        |u|^2 = u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      The notions of length and difference allow me to define the
      distance between two vectors.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>distance between two vectors</term> <m>u</m> and
          <m>v</m> in <m>\RR^n</m> is the length of their difference:
          <m>|u-v|</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      You can check from the definition that <m>|u-v| = |v-u|</m>, so
      distance doesn't depend on which comes first. If <m>|\cdot|</m>
      were absolute value in <m>\RR</m>, this definition would match
      the notion of distance between numbers on the number line.
      Difference and length are visualized in <xref
      ref="figure-difference-and-length" />.

    <title>The Dot Product</title>
    <p>
      Earlier, I said that I couldn't multiply two vectors together.
      That's mostly true: there is no general product of two vectors
      <m>uv</m>, which is still a vector, as least none that has any
      useful or reasonable geometric meaning.  However, there are
      other kinds of <sq>multiplication</sq> which combine two
      vectors. The operation defined here starts with two
      vectors, but the result is a scalar.
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>dot product</term> or <term>inner product</term>
          or <term>scalar product</term> of two vectors <m>u</m> and
          <m>v</m> is given by the following formula.
          <me>
            u \cdot v = (u_1,u_2,u_3) \cdot (v_1,v_2,v_3) = 
            u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + u_3 v_3
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The dot product relates to angles between vectors in an
      important way.
    </p>
    <proposition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are two vectors in <m>\RR^n</m>, then
          the angle between them <m>\theta</m> satisfies this equation.
          <me>
            \cos \theta = \frac{u \cdot v}{|u||v|}
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
      This can be used to calculate the angle between two vectors
      simply by calculating the inverse cosine. 
      <me>
        \theta = \arccos \left( \frac{u \cdot v}{|u||v|} \right)
      </me>
      The output of the inverse cosine is an angle in the range <m>[0,
      \pi] </m>. This convention works well for vectors, since the
      angle between them can always be chosen to be in this range.  
      Alternative, if the angle is known, this can be another way to
      calculate the dot product. 
      <me>
        n \cdot v = |u||v| \cos \theta
      </me>
      A useful implication of this relationship between angles and
      dot-products is that dot products can be used to identify
      perpendicular vectors.

    <title>The Cross Product</title>
    <p>
      The cross product is a unique operations in <m>\RR^3</m>.  
    </p>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>u = (u_1,u_2,u_3)</m> and <m>v = (v_1,v_2,v_3)</m> be
          two vectors in <m>\RR^3</m>. The <term>cross product</term>
          of <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> is written <m>u \times v</m> and
          defined by the following formula.
          <me>
            u \times v = (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2,  u_3v_1 - u_1v_3,  u_1v_2 -
            u_2v_1) 
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The cross product differs from the dot product in several
      important ways. First, it produces a new vector in
      <m>\RR^3</m>, not a scalar. For this reason, when working in
      <m>\RR^3</m>, the dot product is often referred to as the
      <term>scalar product</term> and the cross product as the
      <term>vector product</term>. Second, the dot product measures,
      in some sense, the similarity of two vectors. The cross product
      measures, in some sense, the difference between two vectors. The
      closer two vectors are to being perpendicular, the larger the
      magnitude of their cross product will be. This contrasts with
      the dot product, which is larger when the vectors are closer to
      being parallel. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The relative direction of the output of the cross-product is
      also notable. 
    </p>
    <prop>
      <statment>
        <p>
          Let <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> be vectors in <m>\RR^3</m>. Then
          <m>v \cdot (u \times v) = 0</m> and <m>u \cdot (u \times v)
          = 0 </m>. Since a dot product of two vectors is zero if and
          only if the vectors are perpendicular, this is equivalent to
          stating that  the vector <m>v \times u</m> is perpendicular
          to both <m>u</m> and <m>v</m>.
        </p>
      </statment>
    </prop>
    <p>
      This property of the cross product turns out to be a very useful
      property: it produces a result that is perpendicular to both
      original vectors. This is part of the reason that it is unique
      to <m>\RR^3</m>: in three dimensions, if you have two set
      (non-parallel) directions, there is a unique direction that is
      perpendicular to both. The cross product constructs that unique
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, a calculation from the definition shows that <m>u
      \times v = -(v \times u)</m>. So far, multiplication of scalars
      and the dot product of vectors have not depended on order. The
      cross product is one of many products in mathematics which
      depends on order. If I change the order of the cross product,
      I introduce a negative sign. An operation which changes sign
      when the order changes is called <term>anti-commutative</term>.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsection-angular-motion">
    <title>Angular Motion</title>
    <p>
      An important application of the cross product is describing
      rotational motion. Linear mechanics describes the motion of an
      object through its environment, but rotational mechanics
      describes the rotation of an object independent of its other
      change in position.  A force on an object can cause both kinds
      of movement, obviously. The following table summarizes the
      parallel definitions of linear motion and rotational motion in

    <p>
      How should I describe torque? If there is a linear force applied
      to an object which can only rotate around an axis, and if the
      linear force is applied at a distance <m>r</m> from the axis, I
      can think of the force <m>F</m> and the distance <m>r</m> as
      vectors. The torque is then <m>\tau = r \times F</m>. Since the
      cross product is zero when vectors are parallel and large when
      vectors are perpendicular, a force perpendicular to the radius
      gives the greatest angular acceleration. That makes sense. If
      <m>F</m> and <m>r</m> share a direction, then the force is
      pushing directly along the axis and no rotation can occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of cross products in rotational dynamics is ubiquitous.
      In fluid dynamics, local rotational motion of the fluid results
      in turbulence, vortices and similar effects. Tornadoes and
      hurricanes are particularly extreme examples of vortices. All
      the descriptions of the force and motion of these vortices
      involve cross products in the vectors describing the fluid. (In
      this course, I will specifically use cross products to discuss
      angular accelration for parametric curves in <xref
      ref="subsection-acceleration" />.)
